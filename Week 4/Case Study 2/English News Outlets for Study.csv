,7/11/2017,"A pro-North Korean newspaper in Japan said Tuesday that President Moon Jae-in should not expect a positive response from Pyongyang to his latest reconciliatory proposal, as Seoul is still not giving up its submission to the United States. The Chosun Sinbo also called on South Korea to end its joint annual military exercises with the U.S. if it hopes to prove its willingness to improve ties. Moon unveiled a broad vision for bringing peace to the Korean Peninsula during his speech in Berlin last Thursday, two days after the North test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). ""If the proposal is based on South Korea's submission to the U.S. and hostility toward the North, Seoul cannot expect Pyongyang's positive response,"" the newspaper said. The paper serves as an unofficial mouthpiece for Pyongyang. North Korea's state media has yet to unveil its official response to Moon's proposal. Moon proposed that the two Koreas mutually suspend acts of hostility along their tense border on the July 27 anniversary of the armistice treaty that ended conflict in the 1950-53 Korean War. He also offered to hold reunions of families torn apart by the war on Oct. 4, Korea's lunar fall harvest holiday and the 10th anniversary of the second inter-Korean summit. The newspaper hinted that Moon's handling of Seoul-Washington military drills would be a yardstick in the North's decision on its policy with South Korea. ""South Korea should show a willingness to improve its relations with Pyongyang not by words, but with action,"" it said. ""It remains to be seen whether South Korea can make a decision to suspend the drills with the U.S., a main source of tension on the Korean Peninsula."" Pyongyang has long denounced the joint military drills as a rehearsal for a northern invasion despite Seoul and Washington's assurance that they are defensive in nature. North Korea's top envoy to India said in June that North Korea can place a moratorium on its nuclear and missile tests if the U.S. suspends the annual joint military drills. But Moon has rejected an idea of ending exercises with Washington.",http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/07/11/0401000000AEN20170711010300315.html,yonhap
Drought hits N. Korean breadbasket hard,7/12/2017,"North Korea's granary zones, including Hwanghae provinces, are suffering great damage due to a drought that began in April, a U.S. broadcaster reported Wednesday. According to data from a joint investigation team, comprising officials from U.N. agencies operating in the communist country, about 16 percent of all farmland in South Hwanghae Province was heavily affected by drought, with 40 percent of the farmland in the Kangryong and Jangyon counties dried up, Voice of America said. In particular, 59 percent of the farmland in Jangpung County in North Hwanghae Province was ruined by drought, the broadcaster said, adding that rice paddies suffered more damage than corn fields. ""We plan to request a U.N. emergency fund as the nutritional conditions of children, pregnant women and lactating mothers in the Hwanghae provinces and Nampo City in North Pyongyan Province can be more vulnerable due to drought,"" the investigation team was cited as saying. Last week, another American broadcaster, Radio Free Asia, quoted the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) as stating that the yield in Pyongan, Hwanghae and Nampo City is expected to decline 30-80 percent this year from a year ago",http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/07/12/0401000000AEN20170712002900315.html,yonhap
Number of N.K. defectors falls 21 pct on-year in H1: data,7/12/2017,"The number of North Koreans escaping to South Korea declined 20.8 percent in the first half from a year earlier, government data showed Wednesday, as the North has been strengthening border control. A total of 593 North Koreans came to South Korea in the January-June period, compared with 749 tallied last year, according to preliminary data by the Ministry of Unification. As of end-June, the total number of North Korean defectors stood at 30,805, the data showed. The tally topped the 30,000 mark in November last year. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is believed to have ordered tightened surveillance over people since he assumed power in late 2011. Since the second half of 2015, North Korea has bolstered border control and set up high-tension wires around the Tumen River, which flows between the North and China, to prevent more North Koreans from escaping the country, according to a report by the Korea Institute for National Unification. North Korean female defectors accounted for 85 percent of the total in the first half, the data showed. The yearly number of defectors reaching the South peaked at 2,914 in 2009, but the pace of growth had fallen off since 2011. But last year, the pace of annual growth of the North defectors picked up for the first time since 2011. Defections by North Korean elites also rose in 2016 amid tightened international sanctions, government officials said.",http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/07/12/0401000000AEN20170712002100315.html,yonhap
(3rd LD) Earthquake off N. Korea not caused by nuclear test: U.S. Geological Survey,7/13/2017,"A magnitude-5.8 earthquake that occurred off North Korea's east coast Thursday (local time) was not caused by a nuclear test, the U.S. Geological Survey said. The tremor occurred at 4:18 a.m. North Korean time at a depth of 537.6 km below the East Sea, 176 kilometers east-southeast of Hoemul-li, North Korea, the agency said on its website. The quake does not appear to have been caused by a nuclear test, a USGS official said. ""It occurred at 500 km below the seabed. There's no way it was caused by a nuclear test. It's a natural earthquake,"" John Bellini, a geophysicist at the USGS National Earthquake Information Center, told Yonhap by phone. Pentagon spokesman Maj. Jamie Davis also dismissed the possibility of a nuclear test, pointing to its location and depth, Reuters reported. North Korea has conducted five underground nuclear tests since 2006. It is widely expected to carry out more tests following its test-launch last week of an intercontinental ballistic missile. Ultimately, the communist nation aims to build an ICBM capable of hitting the continental U.S. with a nuclear warhead fitted on top. The European-Mediterranean Seismological Center reported Thursday's earthquake to be of magnitude 5.9. It occurred 537 km below the seabed and 193 km southeast of Rajin, northeastern North Korea, the center said. The Hawaii-based Pacific Tsunami Warning Center issued no alerts as a result of the quake.",,yonhap
 Unification minister meets with bizmen investing in Kaesong complex,7/12/2017,"South D5 unification minister on Wednesday met with a group of company officials who ran factories at a now-shuttered industrial complex in North Korea as they called for more compensation for their losses over the closure. Cho Myoung-gyon held a meeting with 14 officials from local firms that invested in the Kaesong Industrial Complex in North Korea's border city of the same name, according to Seoul's unification ministry. ""Since I became the minister, what struck me first was the joint industrial complex,"" the minister said at the start of the meeting.

This photo taken on July 12, 2017, shows Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon (C) speaking at the start of a meeting with officials from local firms that ran factories at the now-shuttered Kaesong Industrial Complex. (Yonhap) This photo taken on July 12, 2017, shows Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon (C) speaking at the start of a meeting with officials from local firms that ran factories at the now-shuttered Kaesong Industrial Complex. (Yonhap) Seoul shut down the complex in February 2016 in response to North Korea's fourth nuclear test and long-range rocket launch last year. The firms claimed that the closure has incurred more than 1.5 trillion won (US$1.4 billion) in financial losses, saying that the government's financial support is not sufficient to cover their damage. Under the government of President Moon Jae-in's predecessor, South Korea provided 501.7 billion won in funds to them after calculating their losses at some 786 billion won. At the meeting, the company officials asked the government to provide more funds promptly to cover their losses, including damage to liquid assets, according to the ministry. Cho told them that the government will actively consider assistance from the perspective of state responsibility, though it will take into account the degree of their business normalization and state finances. South Korea's unification ministry earlier said the resumption of the industrial park would hinge on progress in the resolution of North Korea's nuclear and missile problems. A resumption of the complex could spur a dispute over South Korea's possible violation of international sanctions. Opened in 2004, the factory zone had housed 124 South Korean firms hiring more than 54,000 North Korean workers to produce labor-intensive goods, such as clothes and utensils.",http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/07/12/0401000000AEN20170712004851315.html,yonhap
N. Korea erects statues of late leaders around 10 places this year,4/8/2017,"North Korea has been seen focusing on setting up statues of founder Kim Il-sung and his late son Kim Jong-il across the country as part of efforts to bolster the personality cult of the Kim family, Radio Free Asia reported Friday.

Curtis Melvin, a researcher at the US-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, told the Washington-based news outlet that the number of such statues being erected in major cities, universities, museums, historical sites and army units is increasing at a fast clip, around 10 locations so far.

One of top priorities for the Kim Jong-un regime proved to be the construction of statues and monuments for Kim Il-sung and Kim Jong-il, said Melvin, who analyzes satellite imagery for clues to North Korean affairs.

According to him, the two Kims' statues have been installed at lower military units as well as the commands of the North's air force and navy.

Such statues at military units are viewed as part of the personality cult the North is trying to build around the Kim family, he said, adding the North is expected to continue to set up the two leaders' statues at major institutions and military units down the road.",http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/08/04/0401000000AEN20170804002300315.html,yonhap
"U.S. Senate passes sanctions on N. Korea, Russia, Iran",07/28/2017,"The U.S. Senate on Thursday passed sanctions aimed at deterring North Korea's missile and nuclear development, as part of a package that also targets Russia and Iran.

The bill passed the Senate 98-2, despite objections from President Donald Trump. Two days earlier, the legislation passed the House with overwhelming support of 419-3.

It will now be sent to Trump to sign into law or veto.

The part on North Korea authorizes sanctions on those providing the country with crude oil and other related products.

It prohibits ""any ships owned by the government of North Korea or owned or operated on behalf of any country not complying with U.N. Security Council resolutions from operating in United States waters or landing at any U.S. port.""

   It also bans ""goods produced in whole or part by North Korean forced labor from entering the United States and sanctions foreign persons that employ North Koreans who are forced to labor in inhumane conditions and are denied access to wages and benefits.""

   The measures, which passed the House in a standalone bill in May, were added to the Russia and Iran package before the House vote Tuesday.

The legislation also prevents Trump from unilaterally lifting sanctions on Russia and adds fresh ones for its alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Trump objected to the bill as he insists he received no help from Moscow to win the presidential race and underscores the importance of bilateral cooperation on issues, such as counterterrorism and the war in Syria.

The legislation also calls for sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities with ties to the country's ballistic missile programs.",http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/07/28/0401000000AEN20170728000800315.html,yonhap
USFK commander: Kim Jong-un's goal is to break unity among regional powers,07/27/2017,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is attempting to deter unity between South Korea, the U.S., China, Russia and Japan with a string of belligerent acts, the top American military commander here said Thursday.

Gen. Vincent K. Brooks, who commands U.S. Forces Korea (USFK), pointed out that the communist regime's nearly weekly missile tests have become ""the new normal.""

   The North test-fired 28 ballistic missiles in 2016 alone, followed by 10 others this year, including what is believed to be an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).

It's also reportedly preparing for another missile launch in the coming days, although there was no report of a launch on Thursday, the 64th anniversary of the Korean War Armistice Agreement.

""His actions intend to sow friction and fissures among the five in order to prevent them from coming together as a cohesive block,"" Brooks said, addressing a forum under way in Nebraska, a U.S. state, according to the USFK's website.

The two-day symposium on deterrence is being hosted by the U.S. Strategic Command.

""He's trying to prevent the creation of a closed fist against him,"" the commander said, showing the five fingers of his hand to refer to the five countries involved in the now-suspended denuclearization talks with Pyongyang.

He described the North Korea issue as a ""wicked problem"" and called for a ""creative"" approach to resolve it by pooling the wisdom of various people.

He also stressed the importance of deterrence for the part of the U.S. and its allies.

""Deterrence aims to cause adversaries to reconsider their resolve to accept whatever consequences might emerge from their actions and to choose something less than having an adversary try to break their will -- in other words, bringing an adversary to his senses,"" he said.

Compellence, however, must remain an option if North Korea does not choose to be deterred instead, he added.

He appreciated South Korea's efforts to improve its own defense power including the purchase of F-35 stealth jets, AH-64 Apache helicopters, more Aegis-equipped warships and the upgrade to Patriot missiles, coupled with the decision to deploy the THAAD missile shield.

South Korea has increased its defense budget to over US$34 billion in 2017, 2.6 percent of its gross domestic product. The Moon Jae-in administration stated that it would raise the ratio to 2.9 percent within the next five years.

""These capabilities invested in by the Republic of Korea will add to the ongoing efforts to reduce North Korea's ability to hold the Republic of Korea (South Korea) and the U.S. forces present at risk,"" said Brooks.

He is wearing two other hats -- the head of the United Nations Command (UNC) and the allies' Combined Forces Command.

The UNC has preserved the armistice that ended the 1950-53 conflict, he noted, as the command held a ceremony to mark the armistice anniversary at the truce village of Panmunjom on Thursday.",http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/07/27/0401000000AEN20170727009800315.html,yonhap

According to the report, Ethiopia has also imposed a restriction on entry into or transit through Ethiopia by North Korea's government officials and armed forces who are associated with the nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

Pyongyang condemns U.S. travel ban on N. Korea,4/8/2017,"North Korea on Friday condemned a United States move to ban its citizens from traveling to the North, claiming that it is a ""dirty"" scheme to restrain exchanges among people.

The U.S. government said that U.S. nationals will be barred from traveling to North Korea starting next month on safety concerns if they don't have designated specific reasons, including compelling humanitarian purposes.

North Korea's foreign ministry lashed out at the U.S. move, claiming that it is part of Washington's hostile policy toward Pyongyang.

""The move is a dirty scheme aimed at limiting human exchanges to prevent U.S. citizens from seeing North Korea as it is and a failure of its hostile policy. This reflects Washington's view that it regards us as an enemy,"" a ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by the Korean Central News Agency.

Washington's travel ban came after U.S. college student Otto Warmbier was released in a coma from North Korea in June following a 17-month detention and died days after a medical evacuation.

Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for what North Korea called a subversive act of stealing a propaganda sign.

The North claimed that a sovereign state has a right to punish criminals under the law, defending itself against the angry reaction from the U.S. following Warmbier's death.

North Korea said that it has no intent to block Americans hoping to visit it.

""The door is always open to all Americans who want to visit North Korea with good faith and see its real state,"" the spokesman said.",http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/northkorea/2017/08/04/0401000000AEN20170804006000315.html,yonhap

"DPRK accuses U.S., South Korea of intensifying war preparations",11/7/2017,"he Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) Tuesday accused the United States and South Korea of intensifying war preparations after it launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) earlier this month.
""It was reported that the U.S. Department of Defense, much scared by the DPRK's success of test-launch of ICBM Hwasong-14 at one go, had a military attack scenario in the making such as hurling fighters and warships into the waters off the Korean peninsula,"" said the official daily newspaper Minju Joson (Democratic Korea).
The DPRK declared on July 4 that it successfully launched an ICBM on the same day, hailing it as the ""final gate to rounding off the state nuclear force.""
The launch has aroused grave concern from Russia and China, and drawn strong condemnation from the United Nations, South Korea and Japan, as it seriously violated relevant UN Security Council resolutions.
Minju Joson also accused South Korea of holding joint ballistic missile drills with U.S. forces to ""deliberately escalate tensions"" after the missile launch.
Meanwhile, Rodong Sinmun, the official daily of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, charged that South Korean military forces recently took part in the U.S.-led air defense exercises in Alaska.
""They set in motion air force including KF-16 fighter bombers formation to stage bomber guided exercises, coordinated precision bomb dropping drill and air refueling drill targeting surprise attack at key facilities of the DPRK,"" it said.
The paper also criticized South Korea for its ""commemoration of the 15th anniversary of the second Yonphyong naval skirmish,"" which broke out between patrol boats of the DPRK and South Korea along a disputed maritime boundary in the Yellow Sea in 2002.
Rodong Sinmun remarked that ""trumpeting dialogue"" is meaningless as long as Seoul does not abandon a policy of confrontation with Pyongyang, in reference to repeated appeals for dialogue by South Korean President Moon Jae-in.
""The South Korean authorities are well advised to stop the foolish act of challenging the nation's desire and will for the improvement of the north-south relations and peace and reunification of the country, and behave with discretion,"" it added.

Clear THAAD hurdle for comeback of China-South Korea ties,7/6/2017,"Chinese President Xi Jinping met on Thursday with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in on the sidelines of the upcoming 12th summit of G20 in Hamburg, Germany, the first in-person meeting between them since Moon took office in May.
Just as expected, the issue of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system, regarded as the biggest problem in Beijing-Seoul ties, tops the agenda of the meeting.
The installation of THAAD system by Seoul and Washington under the excuse of countering Pyongyang's growing military threats gravely harms the strategic security interests of regional countries including Russia and China.
It is clear to all that the system has failed to curb the nuclear ambitions of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). Instead it encourages mistrust and suspicion, increases Pyongyang's sense of insecurity while compromising world efforts to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula.
On Tuesday, the DPRK test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile, which it claims to be capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead, further dimming the prospects for breaking the impasse.
China and Russia have urged the DPRK to strictly abide by the UN Security Council resolutions. They also sent a warning that ""any outsider should not increase its military deployment and presence in Northeast Asia under the excuse of opposing Pyongyang's nuclear and missile plans.""
President Xi and his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin said the THAAD deployment in South Korea ""concerns the strategic balance in the region.""
Xi also said that Beijing and Moscow ""will take necessary measures, jointly or individually, to safeguard their national security interests and the regional strategic balance.""
Moon, who advocates both sanctions on Pyongyang and engagement with it, has stressed that no second Korean War could be allowed. Sure, Should war break out on the peninsula, it is Seoul and the South Korean people that would suffer destructive blows and THAAD would become the primary target for attacks from the North.
The snap decision on THAAD is a hot potato passed over by the conservative former President Park Geun-hye. The new government needs to positively seek a way out to shake off the burden, not instead ask for a suspension of counter-THAAD steps taken by countries concerned.
Moon has denied a cancellation of the U.S. battery while holding off the installation of another four launchers and ordering an environment impact assessment before its complete deployment. There is still time for his government to correct the ill-advised choice and thaw out the bilateral ties before too late.
Calling off THAAD installation and jump-starting denuclearization talks at an early date remain the most favorable solution to cooling down heightened tensions in the region, putting China-South Korea ties back on track and establishing long-lasting peace in Northeast Asia.
Tough call as it may be, it will serve the interests of all.",http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0706/c90780-9238210.html,en_cn
"China urges calm, US threatens force at emergency UN meeting on DPRK",06/0717,"China slammed the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) over its launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), while calling on all parties concerned to show restraint during an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council on Wednesday.
The DPRK conducted its first successful test-firing of an ICBM on Tuesday, with the US, Japan and South Korea immediately demanding an emergency meeting of the UN Security Council.
Liu Jieyi, China's permanent representative to the United Nations (UN), said that the DPRK's latest launch was a serious violation of Security Council resolutions and was against the will of the entire international community.
""We strongly urge the DPRK to strictly abide by the resolutions of the Security Council and put a stop to any rhetoric and action that might further exacerbate the tension on the Peninsula,"" Liu said.
But at the same time, he called on all stakeholders in the Korean Peninsula ""avoid provocative actions and flagrant rhetoric, demonstrate the will for unconditional dialogue, and work actively together to defuse the tension.""
The US took a tougher attitude towards the DPRK at the meeting, warning that it is ready to use force if needed.
""One of our capabilities lies with our considerable military forces. We will use them if we must, but we prefer not to have to go in that direction,"" said US Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley. But she said that they ""prefer not to go in that direction.""
She also urged China to do more to force the DPRK to give up its nuclear program.
""Much of the burden of enforcing UN sanctions rests with China. Ninety percent of trade with North Korea [the DPRK] is from China. We will work with China. We will work with any and every country that believes in peace. But we will not repeat the inadequate approaches of the past that have brought us to this dark day,"" said Haley.
The US ambassador added that the US would propose new UN sanctions on the DPRK in the coming days, and warned that US leaders will take their ""own path"" if Russia and China did not support the move.
China and Russia opposed new sanctions against the DPRK, instead backing a compromise.
Russian Deputy Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov said Russia expected the DPRK to ""declare a moratorium on the testing of nuclear explosive devices and the testing of ballistic missiles,"" but at the same time called the US and the South Korea to refrain from conducting full-scale joint training exercises.
""All must acknowledge that sanctions will not resolve the issue,"" said Safronkov at the emergency council session. He added that ""any attempts to justify a military solution are inadmissible.""

S.Korean president hopes DPRK would not cross bridge of no return,7/4/2017,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Tuesday expressed his hope that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) would not cross a bridge that it cannot return following the DPRK's test of a new type of ballistic missile.
Moon made the remarks during his meeting with visiting former British Prime Minister David Cameron, according to the presidential Blue House.
The South Korean leader, who took office on May 10, said he will not be sure about how his country and the United States would react if the DPRK crosses the ""red line"" and does not positively respond to the proposal of the Korean Peninsula denuclearization in a peaceful manner agreed upon by Moon and U.S. President Donald Trump.
Moon visited Washington to hold his first summit meeting with Trump for two days from last Thursday. According to the joint statement released after the meeting, President Trump supported South Korea's ""leading role"" in fostering an environment for peaceful reunification of the Korean Peninsula.
Moon told Cameron that the DPRK did not positively respond to the peace initiative of the peninsula based on the complete denuclearization, expressing his hope that Pyongyang should not cross a bridge of no return.
His comments followed the DPRK's test-launch of a ballistic missile early Tuesday.
According to South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), the DPRK fired off a ballistic missile into its eastern waters from an area near Banghyeon, North Pyongan province in the DPRK's northwest region at around 9:40 a.m. local time (0040 GMT).
The DPRK declared later in the day that it has successfully launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
The missile flew 933 km and was lofted as high as 2,802 km to travel for 39 minutes and strike the target in its eastern waters, according to the DPRK's media report.
Right after being briefed on the DPRK's missile firing, Moon convened the national security council meeting of the Blue House, saying it was in a clear violation of UN Security Council resolutions and defies repeated warnings from the international community.
The JCS said in a separate statement that whether the DPRK-fired missile had a capability of an ICBM was still being analyzed by the military authorities of South Korea and the United States.",http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0704/c90777-9237077.html,en_cn
DPRK fires ballistic missile into east waters,7/4/2017,"The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has fired an unidentified ballistic missile into its eastern waters, South Korea's defense ministry said Tuesday.
A defense ministry official told Xinhua that the DPRK fired off the ballistic missile into the East Sea from an area near Banghyeon, North Pyongan province in the DPRK's northwest region at about 9:40 a.m. local time (0040 GMT).
The missile launch was immediately reported to President Moon Jae-in, the official said.
A Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) official told a regular press briefing of the defense ministry that the military was analyzing a maximum altitude and a flying distance of the missile, noting that South Korea's military was maintaining full preparedness for any further DPRK provocation.
In the initial analysis by the military authorities of South Korea and the United States, the DPRK's missile launch was reportedly successful.
Citing Japanese media reports, South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that the DPRK missile may have landed in Japan's exclusive economic zone.
The DPRK missile was reported to have flown for about 40 minutes, but the JCS official refused to confirm the media speculation.
Pyongyang test-launched ground-to-ship cruise missiles on June 8 from Wonsan area in the country's eastern region.
The DPRK's Tuesday firing of the ballistic missile followed South Korean President Moon's first summit meeting with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington for two days from June 29.
President Moon has ordered the convening of the national security council meeting of the presidential Blue House, where cabinet members and senior presidential secretaries in charge of security and foreign affairs gather to discuss security issues.
Senior presidential press secretary Yoon Young-chan told reporters that the meeting was scheduled to be held at 11:30 a.m. local time (0230 GMT) at the Blue House.",http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0704/c90777-9236731.html,en_cn
"Japan says time for pressure, not dialogue with N.Korea",7/18/2017,"Japan on Monday downplayed South Korea's offer to hold military talks with North Korea, saying the priority should be piling pressure on Pyongyang through sanctions.

""This is not a time for dialogue. This is a time for pressure,"" Japan's foreign ministry spokesman Norio Maruyama told reporters in New York where Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida was attending a UN meeting on development.

""This is a time to raise pressure in order to conduct a serious dialogue,"" said Maruyama.

South Korea's defence ministry proposed a meeting to be held Friday at the border truce village of Panmunjom to ease tensions after Pyongyang tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile.

If the meeting goes ahead, it would be the first official inter-Korea talks since December 2015.

The offer came as the United States is locked in difficult negotiations with China at the United Nations on a new sanctions resolution in response to the ICBM test.

The tougher measures could include an oil embargo, a ban on North Korean guest workers, banning North Korean ships from all ports and stronger trade restrictions.

Japan supports new sanctions but also maintains that Russia and China must do more to fully implement the current set of measures targeting their economic ties with North Korea.

In the first six months of this year, trade between China and North Korea increased 10.5 percent to $2.5 billion, compared to the same period last year, according to official figures from Beijing.

Iron ore imports from North Korea surged, with China arguing that the UN sanctions resolution allows for trade if the income is used for the livelihood of civilians.

In May, Russia opened a new ferry service from Vladivostok in the far east to North Korea's Rajin port, a move seen as a boost to bilateral ties.

""What is important is to stop the flow of currency to North Korea"" said Maruyama.",https://japantoday.com/category/politics/japan-says-time-for-pressure-not-dialogue-with-n.korea,japan_today
"Nuke ban treaty's threat-of-use reference challenges Japan, allies",7/14/2017,"The inclusion of a phrase outlawing the threat of using nuclear weapons in the world's first nuclear ban treaty recently adopted at the United Nations has given the accord teeth, but also makes it harder for allies of nuclear armed countries to support the pact. ""Nuclear umbrella states"" -- countries like Japan and the Netherlands that receive an extended security deterrent from their nuclear allies -- have so far indicated no willingness to join the treaty though activists hold out hope for change in the future. ""Ever since the U.S. bombed the two cities in Japan in 1945, nuclear weapons have been central to military postures,"" John Burroughs, executive director of the International Association of Lawyers against Nuclear Arms, told Kyodo News on the sidelines of a negotiation conference that ended last Friday with the treaty's historic adoption. He was referring to the atomic bombings in 1945 of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, on Aug. 6 and 9, respectively, that ushered in the nuclear age. The centrality of these weapons to military strategies is demonstrated by the fact that ""governments convey through their doctrines, and sometimes through their statements, that they are ready to use nuclear weapons if the circumstances require,"" Burroughs explained. ""So there is an ongoing threat of use of nuclear weapons that is at the core of doctrines of nuclear deterrence."" It is through that threat that the five nuclear weapon states -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States, the world's largest possessors -- continue justifying nuclear deterrence policies. By extension, they also claim to protect their allies from potential attacks. These arguments seem to have been buoyed in light of North Korea's first intercontinental ballistic missile test on July 4. Supporters are quick to point to new dangers as Pyongyang's technology brings the United States within missile range and Pyongyang unflinchingly pursues its nuclear ambitions, which it says are for self-defense. The five countries, as well as allies including Japan and other nuclear possessors like North Korea, India, Pakistan and Israel all skipped the conference in New York. The only participant among North Atlantic Treaty Organization members was the Netherlands, which voted against the pact. Expressing their opposition, Britain, France and the United States issued a joint statement claiming they would not ""sign, ratify or ever become a party to it."" ""Japan continues to seek for a world without nuclear weapons and we feel that in order to do that we need the cooperation between the nuclear weapon states and non-nuclear weapon states,"" Japan's Ambassador to the United Nations Koro Bessho told Kyodo News, adding that the ban treaty was not the way to bridge the divide. Yet supporters see the treaty's value in setting a new norm by stigmatizing nuclear weapons, as was the case with biological and chemical weapons, land mines and cluster bombs in the past. At the core of the treaty, which was backed by 120 countries, as well as Palestine and the Holy See, was the agreement never ""under any circumstances"" to develop, test, produce, manufacture, acquire, possess or stockpile nuclear weapons. Alongside this concession in Article 1 was the agreement never to ""use or threaten to use nuclear weapons or other explosive devices."" The phrase ""threaten to use"" was only added in the text's third revision. After much debate, some European delegations in particular seemed hesitant to add it, fearing it would dampen support from other members, especially the Netherlands. It was kept and its significance was not lost on activists like Commander Rob Green, who served for 20 years with the British Royal Navy where he once flew nuclear strike aircraft. ""The most important words in this treaty are that it is prohibited to threaten the use of nuclear weapons, that is the heart of the power of this treaty,"" the co-director of the Peace Foundation's Disarmament and Security Center said at a recent panel discussion. ""I do believe that nuclear deterrence has nothing to do with security. It promotes insecurity and proliferation."" Akira Kawasaki, an international steering group member of the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, told Kyodo News that even if the threat-of-use phrase had been deleted, it would not have made a difference as the Dutch rejected the pact due to other wording as well. Other requirements, such as agreeing not to ""assist, encourage or induce"" prohibited activities, and refusing to station, install or deploy nuclear weapons on its territory, posed additional hurdles. The Dutch representative cited ""incompatible"" Article 1 obligations that did not line up with their NATO commitments as among reasons for casting the only no vote. Along with the Netherlands, the countries of Belgium, Germany, Italy and Turkey, as non-nuclear NATO members, collectively host about 180 U.S. nuclear bombs, according to the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. ""Nuclear alliance is all about assisting, encouraging and inducing the use of nuclear weapons, even if those states do not directly possess or use nuclear weapons by themselves,"" said Kawasaki, who also serves as an executive committee member with Japan's Peace Boat. The term ""nuclear umbrella,"" he said, ""has a nuance of protection and defense, but in fact it is to assist others to use nuclear weapons."" Going forward, Kawasaki and others have vowed to carry on by educating the public, as well as politicians and parliamentarians, in hopes of changing perceptions. The treaty has no expiration date, he pointed out, and therefore ""leaves the door open"" for other nations to later join. He hopes to encourage Tokyo to at least attend future meetings. ""A major task lies ahead of us, which is ensuring that everybody comes into the fold of the treaty,"" said Nozipho Joyce Mxakato-Diseko, South Africa's Ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, and a key negotiator whose country renounced nuclear weapons in 1991.""They have a moral duty to join. We have a moral duty to bring them in."" Conference president Elayne Whyte Gomez likened the effort to sowing ""the first seeds"" in a process she admits will take time. The Costa Rican ambassador to Geneva pointed to how even the NPT -- the cornerstone of nuclear disarmament and nonproliferation -- was not universally backed at first by the five nuclear weapon states. It was only in 1992 that China and France acceded to it, long after it entered into force in 1970. For Japanese atomic bomb survivors like Setsuko Thurlow, who has given rousing U.N. speeches, and Toshiki Fujimori, assistant secretary general of the Japan Confederation of A- and H-Bomb Sufferers Organizations, who both witnessed the landmark adoption, the journey continues. ""It is the beginning towards the total ban of nuclear weapons, so it is not over yet, the fight is not over,"" Fujimori emphatically said at a press conference.",https://japantoday.com/category/politics/focus-nuke-ban-treaty%27s-threat-of-use-reference-challenges-japan-allies,japan_today
Japan protests armed N. Korean boat in Tokyo economic zone,7/13/2017,"Japan has protested to North Korea after a Japanese patrol vessel spotted an armed boat believed to be from there allegedly fishing illegally, an official said Thursday. The crew pointed a gun at the Japanese fisheries vessel, forcing it to withdraw, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a news conference. The incident happened last Friday about 500 kilometers (310 miles) west of Japan's northern coast in an area Tokyo claims as its exclusive economic zone, Suga said. Suga said that Japan determined the boat was North Korean by observing and analyzing its crew members as well as other details. The Japanese vessel quickly left the area because of safety concerns, he said. Suga refused to discuss the North Korean boat's activity or intentions except to say that it was operating illegally. Kyodo News service said the boat was allegedly fishing squid illegally and that it chased the Japanese vessel for more than 10 minutes. The area is known as rich fishing grounds and Japanese authorities have been patrolling it for illegal operations. Japan's protest was lodged via North Korea's embassy in Beijing.",https://japantoday.com/category/politics/japan-protests-over-armed-nkorean-boat-off-japanese-coast,japan_today
Missile Wars: Where North Korea stands after ICBM launch,7/13/2017,"North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is on the cusp of having something his father and grandfather could only dream of — the ability to unleash a nuclear attack on the United States. For anyone paying attention, the test launch of his country's first intercontinental ballistic missile on the Fourth of July came as little surprise. He has been racing to develop better and longer-range missiles and vowed this would be the year of the ICBM in his annual New Year's address. He made good on that vow with the launch of the ""Hwasong-14."" But that isn't all he's been doing.
Here's a quick primer.
CLOSING THE GAP North Korea's newest missile is called the Hwasong-14. Hwasong means ""Mars."" Experts believe the two-stage, liquid-fuel missile gives Kim the capability of reaching most of Alaska and possibly Hawaii. Some experts add Seattle and San Francisco. North Korea's missiles aren't very accurate, so big, soft targets like cities are what they would be aimed at. Big caveat: Kim's technicians still have a lot of work to do. It's not clear if this missile could be scaled up to reach targets beyond Alaska, like New York or Washington. Reliability is also a big issue that requires years of testing to resolve. And that liquid fuel makes the missile a sitting duck while it's being readied for launch.
DIVERSIFYING THE ARSENAL Along with a record number of tests, 17 this year alone, Kim has revealed a surprising array of missiles — Harpoon-style anti-ship missiles, beefed up Scuds, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and missiles that use solid fuel, which makes them easier to hide and harder to destroy. David Wright, with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said heightened activity over the past 18 months suggests Kim decided a couple of years ago to speed up and diversify. The takeaway: North Korea is well on its way toward a fine-tuned arsenal of missiles that can strike South Korea, Japan and the United States. PUSHING THE ENVELOPE What's next? More sanctions, almost certainly. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed ""severe things"" could be in the offing. The U.S. has circulated a new list of sanctions in the U.N. Security Council and U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley put the world, and especially China, ""on notice"" if it doesn't toe Washington's line. China, North Korea's economic lifeline, has reduced its imports from the North, including a cutoff of coal purchases. It appears to still be selling lots of goods to North Korea, which may anger some sanctions advocates but generates a huge trade deficit that could spell destabilizing inflation for the North if left unchecked. North Korea, meanwhile, needs to improve its nuclear warhead technology. Its Punggye-ri underground nuclear test site has been on standby for months. So a test is fairly likely. And there will be more launches. As Kim put it, expect lots more ""gift packages, big and small"" for Washington.",https://japantoday.com/category/world/missile-wars-where-north-korea-stands-after-icbm-launch,japan_today
"Opinions
Dealing with N Korea: Even allies have different priorities",7/11/2017,"One reason North Korea is the world's most dire nuclear hotspot is that among the most important players, even allies and semi-allies have different desires and priorities. An enemy to some, a bulwark to others, a frustration to all, with decades of unfinished business coloring the picture in ways unique to each nation.

North Korea's successful launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile July 4 raised the heat on tensions that have been building for decades, leaving the international community scrambling for an answer to containing Pyongyang's nuclear ambitions.

Below, Associated Press journalists who cover the standoff from both Koreas, Japan, China and the U.S. explain how each country hopes it is resolved.

SOUTH KOREA

The ultimate dream for South Korea is clear: A unified Korean Peninsula, led by Seoul and its values.

The problem, of course, and the source of seven decades of animosity and bloodshed, is that North Korea harbors a mirror image of that ambition.

In the short term, what South Korea wants depends entirely on who you ask.

That group of elderly men in camouflage and combat boots who are burning an effigy of North Korea's dictator on a Seoul street won't have the same goals as the North Korea sympathizer who slashed the face of U.S. Ambassador Mark Lippert in 2015.

After a decade of hard-line conservative rule, the current government in Seoul is headed by liberal President Moon Jae-in who wants North Korea to stop conducting nuclear and missile tests so he can begin to implement an engagement policy.

That doesn't look likely to happen any time soon.

Most average South Koreans support the presence of the 28,500 U.S. troops here, as long as crime isn't a problem. They look with unease at North Korean provocations but seem to worry far less than the rest of the world about Pyongyang's threats to annihilate the South.

What they really want is for the economy to soar.

— Foster Klug, AP's bureau chief in Seoul, has covered the Koreas since 2005.

NORTH KOREA

North Korea has made no secret about what its demands are. Nothing is more important to the North's ruling regime than its own survival.

To that end, it wants Washington to abandon its ""hostile policy"" aimed at forcing the country into collapse.

In concrete terms, Pyongyang wants direct talks toward a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, which was halted after what was supposed to be a temporary armistice. Signing a treaty would also mean formal recognition of North Korea by the U.S. government and entail some sort of a security agreement guaranteeing Washington will not attack the North.

In the interim, the North wants an end to huge military exercises the U.S. holds each year with South Korea.

Pyongyang says it ultimately wants to see the Korean Peninsula reunited. Its often-repeated demand is for Washington to stay out and let Koreans decide their own fate.

Though actually achieving any of these demands would be tremendously difficult, and seems to be growing more difficult every year, North Korea has been quite consistent in what it claims to want.

And as long as its leaders feel vulnerable, it's not likely to give up much ground.

— Eric Talmadge, the AP's Pyongyang bureau chief since 2013.

UNITED STATES

The top U.S. priority, apart from defending South Korea as a treaty ally, is to rid the Korean peninsula of nuclear weapons - meaning the North's weapons. The administration of President George H.W. Bush seemed to set the stage in September 1991 when he announced the withdrawal of all naval and land-based tactical nuclear weapons, including from South Korea. Pyongyang not only persisted in its nuclear ambitions but in recent years has accelerated its program and all but closed the door to denuclearization. That has put added -- even urgent -- emphasis on the other U.S. priority: stopping the North from developing a nuclear weapon capable of hitting U.S. soil, while also defending South Korea and Japan, which already are within range of the North's shorter-range missiles. That is why Washington resists talk by China and Russia of halting military exercises with South Korea in exchange for concessions by the North, or withdrawing any of the approximately 28,500 U.S. troops based permanently on the peninsula. Washington sees little point in negotiating a formal end to the Korean War, which was halted in 1953 with an armistice rather than a peace treaty, because it sees far greater urgency in the nuclear issue.
CHINA As the closest thing to what North Korea might call an ally, China is under greater pressure than any nation to curb the regime's provocations and set it on a path to a long-term resolution of the standoff. Yet Beijing insists it doesn't have that kind of influence with Pyongyang, and has largely rejected calls to curtail two-way commerce that accounts for an estimated 90 percent of the North's foreign trade. At the same time, Beijing would like to return to the period in the last decade when it received kudos for hosting six-nation talks in which the North's representatives sat down with the U.S. and others to discuss steps toward ending its nuclear programs in return for incentives. With no prospects for an immediate return to negotiations, China has instead been pushing for a ""dual suspension"" in which the North temporarily halts its nuclear and missile tests while South Korea and the U.S. put large-scale war games on hold. That could facilitate talks, calming the situation and preserving the status quo whereby North Korea continues to act as a buffer between China and the pro-U.S. South. China's relations with Pyongyang may be in deep freeze, and the North's actions could spur rivals the U.S. and Japan to responses that could work to China's disadvantage. But ultimately, the specter of a North Korean collapse is far, far scarier to the rulers in Beijing.
JAPAN As a staunch American ally, Japan cooperates closely with Washington and backs it in stepping up pressure on North Korea to counter the growing threat from its missile and nuclear programs. Japan, a non-nuclear state and home to 50,000 American troops, relies on the U.S. ""nuclear umbrella"" under a bilateral security treaty as a deterrent, and is wary of any escalation in military tensions in the region. It seeks to avoid becoming embroiled in U.S. military actions but is taking a leadership role with the U.S. and South Korea in lobbying other countries, especially China and Russia, to enforce economic sanctions against the North. Given its proximity to North Korea, Tokyo has sought to exert leverage through diplomacy, such as six-party talks aimed at ending North Korea's nuclear program, and its own bilateral efforts to get Pyongyang to repatriate Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea. More than a dozen Japanese nationals kidnapped and taken to North Korea decades ago to be trained as agents are still believed to be alive, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has made their safe return home one of his top priorities. While an actual attack could bring disaster, the North Korean threat lends Abe leverage in drumming up public support for a stronger military and missile defense systems.",https://japantoday.com/category/features/opinions/Dealing-with-N-Korea-Even-allies-have-different-priorities,japan_today
S. Korea seeks rare talks with North to ease military tensions,7/17/2017,"South Korea on Monday offered to hold rare military talks with the North, aiming to ease tensions after Pyongyang tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile.

The offer of talks, the first since South Korea elected dovish President Moon Jae-In, came as the Red Cross in Seoul proposed a separate meeting to discuss reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.

The South's defence ministry proposed a meeting to be held on Friday at the border truce village of Panmunjom, while the Red Cross offered to hold talks on August 1 at the same venue.

If the government meeting goes ahead, it will mark the first official inter-Korea talks since December 2015. Moon's conservative predecessor, Park Geun-Hye, had refused to engage in substantive dialogue with Pyongyang unless the isolated regime made a tangible commitment to denuclearisation.

""We make the proposal for a meeting... aimed at stopping all hostile activities that escalate military tension along the land border,"" the defence ministry said in a statement.

The Red Cross said it hoped for ""a positive response"" from its counterpart in the North, hoping to hold a family reunions in early October. If realised, they would be the first in two years.

Millions of families were separated by the conflict that sealed the division of the two countries. Many died without getting a chance to see or hear from their families on the other side of the heavily-fortified border, across which all civilian communication is banned.

With the passage of time, the number of survivors has diminished, with only around 60,000 left in the South.

Moon, who took power in May, has advocated dialogue with the nuclear-armed North as a means of bringing it to the negotiating table as tensions soar over its weapons ambitions.

But Pyongyang has staged a series of missile launches in violation of UN resolutions, most recently on July 4 when it test-fired its first ICBM, a move which triggered global alarm and a push by President Donald Trump to impose harsher UN sanctions on the country.",https://japantoday.com/category/politics/s.-korea-seeks-rare-talks-with-north-to-ease-military-tensions,japan_today

Foreign Minister: US and S. Korea considering secondary boycott on N. Korea,7/11/2017,"Measures to freeze out companies and banks in third countries that do business with N. Korea likely to draw objection from China
In a National Assembly Foreign Affairs & Unification Committee hearing on July 10, Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said that South Korea and the United States are considering using a “secondary boycott” on companies and banks in third countries that are doing business with North Korea, in order to make sanctions against the North more effective.
Minister Kang’s revelation about the secondary boycott option came in answer to a question by Liberty Korea Party lawmaker Yoon Sang-hyun about what measures the government was taking in response to North Korea’s firing of a Hwasong-14 ICBM on July 4.
Kang said, “The United States seems to be trying to maximize the effectiveness of economic sanctions against the North either through United Nations Security Council resolutions or on its own if a Security Council resolution proves unsatisfactory. We will cooperate closely in any case.”
A secondary boycott, which was the policy applied to solve the Iran nuclear issue, is regarded as the toughest option if the US decides to impose sanctions on its own. However, China may strongly oppose such a move because the sanctions would also be directed at any Chinese firms doing business with North Korea, and in the summit between the US and China held in early April, the US agreed to hold off on a secondary boycott in exchange for China’s assurance that it would crack down on illegal dealings with North Korea by Chinese firms.
In answer to a question posed by Minjoo Party lawmaker Lee Seok-hyeon about whether a secondary boycott was discussed at a dinner attended by South Korean, Japanese, and US leaders during the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Kang said, “I think it would be inappropriate for me to give details about what was said there, but I can say that, because the dinner took place right after the North’s missile launch, many opinions were expressed about imposing additional sanctions.”
In this hearing, ruling-party and opposition lawmakers argued vociferously about the results of President Moon’s diplomatic efforts at the G-20 Summit and in the summit with the US and about the direction South Korea’s policies are taking towards the North. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle for the most part gave positive assessments of the return to summit diplomacy, but opposition lawmakers criticized the peace plans presented by President Moon in Berlin as being “unrealistic” and pointed out that international cooperation takes priority in applying sanctions and other forms of pressure. The ruling-party participants countered that “a bolder plan is needed that comprises sanctions, dialogue, and cooperation at the same time.”
The lawmakers posed several questions about the feasibility of four major proposals President Moon made in a speech he delivered at the Korber Foundation in Berlin on July 6: divided family reunions, North Korean participation in the 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics, the cessation of hostilities around the Military Demarcation Line, and North-South relations with sanctions in place.
Minister of Unification Cho Myoung-gyon replied, “It would be hard to claim that it is highly probable that we will be able to successfully carry out all these things, but they are urgent issues and inter-Korean relations have been worsening, so we will push ahead with patience and perseverance to build mutual trust and restore inter-Korean relations to a securer footing.",http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/802357.html,hankyoreh

Let North Korea keep some nukes? Robert Gates lays out a vision for a solution,7/12/2017,"Former US Secretary of Defense outlines three principles, including ruling out a military strike and acknowledgment of China’s crucial role
The opinion that North Korea should be guaranteed nuclear missiles in a limited capacity, and that there should be a change in the military forces stationed on the Korean peninsula, has made its way into mainstream discourse in the US as the solution to North Korean nuclear and missile issues.
Former US Secretary of Defense Robert Gates proposed that acknowledging the North Korean regime, signing a peace treaty with the regime, and partially changing the structure of the US forces stationed within South Korea would be necessary to the solution. Going further, he even laid out a plan in which North Korea would be guaranteed its nuclear weapons, under the condition of inspections. These opinions were published in Wall Street Journal columnist Gerald F. Seib’s piece on July 10 in the Journal, based on an interview with Gates and titled, “What Would Gates Do? A Defense Chief’s Plan for North Korea.”
Gates worked with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the Lyndon Johnson administration in the 1960s, and served as CIA director and Secretary of Defense in both Republican and Democratic administrations. In the security field in the US, Gates is representative of a mainstream, realistic approach.
Gates posits three principles for the solution of the North Korean nuclear problem: the exclusion of a military strike on North Korea as an option, the acknowledgement of China’s crucial role, and the need for a preliminary agreement with China before any direct negotiations with North Korea. He argues that, in accordance with these principles, the US should demonstrate to China that it is ready to acknowledge the North Korean regime and giving up its policy of pushing for regime change, prepare for the signing of a peace treaty with North Korea, and consider the partial change of the structure of the US armed forces in South Korea.
In particular, Gates also proposed a system wherein North Korea would be guaranteed its nuclear weapons in a limited capacity, under the condition of inspections. In other words, the US would propose to China that although North Korea would be permitted, in this limited capacity, to retain 10 to 20 nuclear weapons, it would have to agree to inspections to ensure that it would not acquire additional nuclear weapons or further develop the reach of the weapons.
Gates’ program of guaranteeing North Korea’s nuclear weapons seems to be a system wherein the nuclear weapons are not destroyed, but maintained in a permanently stunted program. Gates said, “I think you cannot get the North to give up their nuclear weapons,” and “Kim sees them as vital to survival. But you may be able to get them to keep the delivery systems to very short range.”
Gates argued that only after China agreed to these proposals would the US be able to begin negotiating with North Korea directly. Gates said, “If that is an outcome you cannot accept, we are going to take steps in Asia you hate.” Meaning the US could, heavily populate Asia with missile defenses,“ including missile-defense buildups in South Korea, Japan and aboard US ships stationed in the Pacific.",http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/802513.html,hankyoreh
NIS says North Korea hasn’t yet developed ICBM reentry technology,7/12/2017,"Analysis also shows that North Korea is ready for another nuclear test, but no imminent signs detected
According to the National Intelligence Service (NIS) analysis of North Korea’s launch of the Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 4, although the North has achieved long-range capability, it appears to lack atmospheric reentry technology.
Members of the National Assembly Intelligence Committee said that in a hearing on July 11, NIS Director Suh Hoon said, “The NIS’s tentative assessment of North Korea’s ICBM capability is that it has succeeded in developing a long-range ballistic missile, but considering the fact that it was launched from a fixed launcher, the development of North missile technology still seems to be in its beginning stages.”
The NIS says the Hwasong-14 is an upgraded version of the mid-range Hwasong-12 that the North fired successfully on May 14. The first stage uses the Hwasong-12 engine, and the second stage has the kind of small engine that was tested in a satellite launch test conducted in Dongchang Village, North Pyongan Province in June last year. The Intelligence Committee added, “We aren’t certain yet, but considering the lack of a heat-resistant warhead shield in the experiment, it appears that the North has not succeeded in developing reentry technology.”
About North Korean nuclear tests, the NIS said, “The nuclear test site at Punggye Village is ready to go whenever Kim Jong-un gives the word, but there are no signs that another test is imminent.”
The NIS also says that the international community is toughening restrictions on North Korea in the wake of its missile launch and that the North conducted only 33 diplomatic exchanges with 17 countries during the first half of this year, which is the lowest rate since Kim Jong-un took power (68 in 2012 down to 38 in 2016).",http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/802516.html,hankyoreh
North Korea threatens “follow-up” measures to possible UNSC resolution,15/07.2017,"Sanctions over recent ICBM launch would be attempt “to obliterate our right to autonomy and survival,” N. Korean Foreign Ministry says
North Korea is threatening “follow-up measures” in the event of an additional United Nations Security Council (UNSCR) resolution sanctioning it for the test-launch of its Hwasong-14 intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM).
The message on the afternoon of July 14 came in the form of a Foreign Ministry spokesperson’s response to questions from the Korean Central News Agency (KCNA).
“Flustered by the successful test-launch of our intercontinental ballistic rocket Hwasong –14, the US is in a frenzy trying to drum up an unheard-up ‘ultra-intense sanctions resolution’ opposing us in the UN Security Council,” the spokesperson said.
“It’s making a real fuss about passing around the new ‘sanctions resolution’ draft [at the UNSC] and talking about putting it up for a vote without any compromising,” the spokesperson said.
“The US’s play in adopting a ‘sanctions resolution’ against North Korea is an expression of its heinous desire to cover up its own misdeeds in forcing us to strengthen our nuclear arms with its extreme hostile policies toward North Korea and extortion tactics using nuclear threats, while seeking to obliterate our right to autonomy and survival,” the spokesperson added.
The spokesperson also warned, “With the total success of the Hwasong-14 test launch, we have clearly shown our ability and commitment to strike at the heart of the US and instantly annihilate it if it does something rash.”
“If there is another ‘sanctions resolution’ from the UNSC, we will take appropriate follow-up measures and answer with an act of justice.”",http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/802949.html,hankyoreh
South Korea to propose military talks with North Korea as early as next week,7/17/2017,"Proposal for military talks is a follow-up to Pres. Moon’s vision for inter-Korean rapprochement in Berlin
The South Korean government plans to issue a proposal as early as the beginning of next week for military talks with North Korea to halt hostile activities at the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), sources said.
The proposal is set to be the first follow-up measure for the “Berlin Vision” announced by President Moon Jae-in in Germany on July 6 as a step toward achieving a peace regime on the Korean Peninsula.
A senior government official reported on July 16 that the administration was “fine-tuning plans to propose talks to North Korea within the week.” In his Berlin Vision, Moon proposed marking the 64th anniversary of the armistice agreement on July 27 by having South and North Korea “halt all hostile activities that raise military tensions” at the MDL. A senior official with the Ministry of National Defense said it was “continuing to hold discussions on inter-Korean military talks with the Ministry of Unification and other agencies involved in practical matters.”
The biggest factor in Seoul’s rush to propose military talks with Pyongyang appears to be its sense that time is of the essence. Just ten days remain before the 64th anniversary of the armistice agreement on July 27, when Moon proposed having both sides halt their hostile activities at the MDL. If inter-Korean military talks don‘t happen within the week, the result will be practical difficulties in reaching an agreement on a halt by July 27.
Seoul is expecting a positive response from Pyongyang, which has proposed a halt to hostile activities at the MDL numerous times in the past. A halt was the topic of one of nine questions posed in a recent open letter by North Korea’s National Reconciliation Council on July 6, and echoes the call for “measures to relieve military tensions” in a statement issued by the North’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea for the 17th anniversary of the Joint Declaration of June 15, 2000.
“We considered [the proposal] because [a halt] is something that North Korea also agrees with and thinks is important,” explained an administration official.
University of North Korean Studies professor Yang Moo-jin predicted, “North Korea could agree to inter-Korean military talks, since it was one of the things - along with a large-scale reunification meeting - proposed by the Korean Workers’ Party at its 7th party Congress [in May 2016].”
Indeed, the Ministry of Unification is viewing North Korea‘s first response to the Berlin Vision - published in the Rodong Sinmun newspaper on July 15 in the name of a member of the North Korean public - as “not entirely negative.” The response from Pyongyang came nine days after Moon proposed the vision.
While the commentary criticized the Berlin Vision as “having an undertone of antagonism throughout” and “including a litany of sleep-talking rhetoric that only piles up more obstacles, never mind helping to improve peace and inter-Korean relations,” it also observed, “It is at least fortunate that it included positions that were different from [the administration’s] predecessors, including the pledges to respect and implement the June 15 Joint Declaration and October 4 Statement [of 2007].”
On the commentary, Inje University professor Kim Yeon-chul said, “You can’t really interpret it as a signal that North Korea’s response is going to be positive, but it‘s not bad either.”
“The key is going to be how [the Moon administration] calibrates the relationship between dialogue and sanctions [against North Korea],” Kim predicted.
Analysts are predicting that if the inter-Korean military talks do take place, the two sides will agree to restore their June 4 agreement under the Roh Moo-hyun administration in 2004, in which they pledged to “prevent unintended clashes in the West (Yellow) Sea, halt propaganda activities at the MDL, and remove means of propaganda.” Both sides moved to take down loudspeakers and halt all propaganda broadcasts after the agreement, but the broadcasts were resumed under the Park Geun-hye administration in Jan. 2016 following North Korea’s fourth nuclear test.
Some observers are suggesting Seoul should take measures to unilaterally halt its own loudspeaker broadcasts by July 27 if Pyongyang does not agree to the proposed talks. The view is based on the conclusion that it would beneficial for restoring inter-Korean relations in the long terms to build trust and show a commitment to inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation.",http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/803182.html,hankyoreh
US House submits bill seeking strengthened joint defense posture in response to N. Korea threat,7/17/2017,"Bill also seeks increased deployment of key US assets, including missile defense systems, long-range strategic bombers
On July 14, the US House of Representatives passed an annual defense policy bill that asks the US government to submit a plan for strengthening joint military exercises, military cooperation and missile defense with allies in response to North Korea‘s intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test launch.
The National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2018 that was passed by the House contained a section proposed by Liz Cheney, representative for Wyoming, that describes a plan to strengthen the US’s capability for expanded deterrence and defense commitments to allies in the Asia-Pacific region. The bill passed with 344 in favor and 81 against, and it must still be revised by the Senate.
The bill says, “The United States and South Korea share deep concerns that the nuclear and ballistic missile programs of North Korea and its repeated provocations pose great threats to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.”
For these reasons, the bill instructs the Secretary of Defense to submit a plan for strengthening extended deterrence and defense commitments in consultation with the Pacific Command and the strategic commander within 30 days of the bill becoming law.
According to the bill, this plan should include considerations about increasing joint military exercises, military cooperation and unified defense with allies. Strengthening joint military exercises flies in the face of China’s proposed solution to resolve the North Korean nuclear issue through “simultaneous suspension” of North Korea’s nuclear tests and missile launches and of South Korea and the US‘s joint military exercises.
The bill also asks the government for a plan to increase the conspicuous deployment of key US assets, including missile defense systems, long-range strategic bombers and mid-range bombers. This reflects the attitude of Congress that more military pressure should be put on China and North Korea, but this is likely to only increase tensions in the region.
In addition, the bill asks the government to submit a report about increasing arms sales to allies, planning for drills and deployment of bombers that can carry both nuclear and conventional weapons, and adjusting the strategic nuclear stance, which would include redeploying submarines that can carry cruise missiles armed with nuclear warheads.
Along with this, the bill allocates US$12.5 billion to missile defense that is aimed at countering the ballistic missile threat posed by North Korea and Iran. That’s US$2.5 billion more than the amount initially requested by President Donald Trump.
The bill also includes a section that would ban foreign telecommunication firms from working with the Pentagon if they have knowingly aided or abetted cyber attacks carried out on behalf of the North Korean regime or individuals associated with it. But it also gives Trump the authority to suspend these sanctions for national security purposes.
The National Defense Authorization Act serves as a sort of policy guideline for setting the budget. For these requests to be implemented, the government must draft a concrete plan, and the budget must be actually allocated and finalized by Congress’s Committee on Appropriations.",http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/803183.html,hankyoreh
[News analysis] North Korea could look to add items to military talks agenda,7/18/2017,"No response yet to Moon administration’s proposal, which is aimed at restoring inter-Korean dialogue
After the South Korean government simultaneously proposed military talks and Red Cross talks on July 17, North Korea is likely to be focusing on how to respond.
Seoul is expecting North Korea to respond in the affirmative. “If North Korea is sincere about seeking peace on the Korean Peninsula and the development of inter-Korean relations and respecting past inter-Korean agreements - including the July 4 Joint Statement, the Inter-Korean Basic Agreement, the June 15 Joint Statement and the Oct. 4 Summit Statement - then it must respond positively to our sincere proposal,” said Unification Minister Cho Myung-gyun. “We expect that the North will respond positively,” agreed Vice Defense Minister Suh Choo-suk while he was proposing military talks on the same day.
Indeed, the mood in the Unification Ministry is one of cautious expectation that Pyongyang will concur with Seoul’s proposals, since North Korea‘s assessment of Moon’s “Berlin Declaration” was not wholly negative. Though North Korea’s Rodong Sinmun newspaper published a detailed rebuttal of the declaration on July 15, it also said “it’s at least fortunate that this contains a series of positions about respecting and promising to implement the June 15 Joint Statement and the Oct. 4 Statement, unlike Moon’s predecessors.”
But it’s too soon to jump to conclusions. North Korea basically has three options to choose from. First, it could reject the separate military talks and Red Cross talks proposed by Seoul and offer instead to hold a new series of talks with a comprehensive agenda. Recent actions suggest that North Korea is trying to test the Moon administration‘s intentions, at this time early in Moon’s presidency. North Korea must confirm whether Seoul really intends to improve inter-Korean relations and what the true intensions of the Berlin Declaration are before it can set a specific course for its future policy toward South Korea. Therefore, Pyongyang could take this opportunity to plan and propose a new framework of interaction or dialogue that it could use to assess the overall tenor of the Moon administration‘s North Korean policy. In Aug. 2015, North Korea proposed high-level talks between Kim Kwan-jin, head of South Korea’s National Security Office, and Hwang Pyong-so, chief of the North Korean military‘s general politburo, both of whom were fully capable of speaking for the leaders of the two sides.
North Korea could also respond separately to the proposals for military talks and for Red Cross talks. But even in this case, the North is likely to make counterproposals for its desired agenda rather than simply acquiescing to Seoul’s proposals. The South’s proposal for military talks is mostly focused on halting hostile activity at the military demarcation line. This basically means suspending the launch of balloons carrying propaganda pamphlets into North Korea and the broadcast of propaganda over loudspeakers along the military demarcation line, as well as preventing unplanned clashes. North Korea has also paid attention to these issues in the interest of protecting the “supreme dignity” of its leader Kim Jong-un. During the 7th Korea Workers’ Party Congress in May 2016, North Korea proposed inter-Korean military talks. “If talks were held between North and South Korean military officials, it would be possible to comprehensively deliberate and resolve issues of mutual interest, such as eliminating the risk of clashes around the military demarcation line and relaxing tensions,” the North said at the time. As a result, North Korea would not seem to have any reason to reject the South‘s proposal for military talks. But it’s also possible that North Korea will counter by calling for the suspension of South Korea-US joint military exercises to be included on the agenda of the talks, which has long been a North Korean objective.
When it comes to the proposal for Red Cross talks, North Korea is not likely to accept an agenda that only addresses the reunions of divided families. North Korea has called for the repatriation of the 12 waitresses from a North Korean restaurant in China who defected in Apr. 2016 and of Kim Ryon-hui, a defector who lives in South Korea and has expressed her desire to return to North Korea. In public responses to nine questions that were published by the Korean Council for Reconciliation and Cooperation on June 23, North Korea said that repatriating these individuals would be an “important touchstone demonstrating [South Korea’s] willingness to improve inter-Korean relations.” If the Red Cross talks are held, the North is likely to bring up these issues.
“There are sure to be points that both sides can raise, and we’ll start looking into the details after we see North Korea‘s response,” Cho said when asked about this issue. This could lead to a tiresome process of back-and-forth between Seoul and Pyongyang about setting the agendas for both the military talks and the Red Cross talks.
It’s also possible that North Korea will completely disregard the South’s proposals. The North could also carry out an additional missile launch or nuclear test without even responding to the proposal, which would further increase tensions on the Korean Peninsula and reinforce the narrative of a confrontation between Pyongyang and Washington from which Seoul is excluded. If such a provocation by North Korea were to coincide with the UN Security Council’s deliberations over sanctions for the North’s launch of the Hwasong-14, its first ICBM, this would likely deliver a major blow to the Moon administration, which is attempting to get the ball rolling on restoring inter-Korean relations early in Moon’s presidency.",http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/803297.html,hankyoreh
[News analysis] Pres. Moon setting his N. Korea policy with proposal for talks,7/18/2017,"Military and Red Cross talks would be a step toward reestablishing inter-Korean communication, and building trust
On July 17, the government of President Moon Jae-in proposed holding inter-Korean military talks to halt hostile activity on the military demarcation line, and Red Cross talks to organize a reunion of families divided by the Korean War. Significantly, Seoul proposed talks to Pyongyang without making any of the stipulations that Moon had previously made, such as waiting for the right conditions or insisting that North Korea halt its provocations and show its willingness to denuclearize. Coming 11 days after Moon unveiled his “Berlin Declaration” in Germany on July 6 as a blueprint for his North Korean policy, the proposals appear to reflect the government‘s resolve to simultaneously resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and restore inter-Korean relations in an attempt to relax tensions and bring peace to the Korean Peninsula.
The government also paid a great deal of attention to the format of the announcement of its proposal to North Korea. At 9 am on July 17, Vice Defense Minister Suh Choo-suk sent a statement (“A Proposal to Hold Inter-Korean Military Talks to Halt All Hostile Activity at the Military Demarcation Line”) to North Korea that proposed holding inter-Korean military talks at Tongilgak (the Unification Building), located on the North Korean side of Panmunjeom, on July 21. At the same time, Kim Seon-hyang, acting president of the Korean Red Cross, proposed holding Red Cross talks at the Peace House on the South Korean side of Panmunjeom on Aug. 1. The goal of the talks would be to organize reunions for divided families and visits to their ancestral graves on Oct. 4, which is not only Chuseok (the Korean harvest festival) but also the 10th anniversary of the Oct. 4 Summit Declaration.

Unification Minister Cho Myung-gyun held a press conference around 11 am and released a statement about follow-up measures to the Berlin Declaration. “Inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation aimed at bringing peace and easing tensions on the Korean Peninsula will give us a chance to help resolve the North Korean nuclear issue and to promote a virtuous cycle of mutual progress on inter-Korean relations and the North Korean nuclear issue,” Cho said in the statement. This means that the proposals announced by the Defense Ministry and by the highest-ranking official at the Red Cross, the people who would be directly in charge of these talks, were both officially recognized by the head of the Unification Ministry, which is in charge of inter-Korean relations. Cho once again emphasized the principle delineated by Moon in his Berlin Declaration that South Korea will not pursue a hostile policy toward the North, the collapse of the North Korean regime or unification by absorption. “We gave careful consideration to the format of the announcement to make it look as formal as possible to the North,” said an official in the Unification Ministry.
On several previous occasions, North Korea has asked for military talks to be held to relax inter-Korean tensions, while South Korea has pushed to hold reunions of the divided families on humanitarian grounds. The proposal to hold the military talks on the North Korean side of Panmunjeom and the Red Cross talks on the South Korean side of Panmunjeom essentially reflects this state of affairs. Simultaneously pursuing the military talks desired by the North and the Red Cross talks desired by the South represents an attempt to prime the pump on inter-Korean dialogue, which has been stalled for more than nine years. “Placing the military talks that North Korea has emphasized first is meant to emphasize to the North that relaxing tensions is the priority. Placing the Red Cross talks after the military talks appears to be aimed at increasing the possibility of bringing the talks off,” said Gu Gab-woo, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies.
Since operations were suspended at the Kaesong Industrial Complex in Feb. 2016, all lines of communication between North and South Korea have been cut. Since then, Seoul has had to use a megaphone at Panmunjeom to inform North Korea each time it returns North Korean fishermen who have drifted into South Korean waters in the East Sea, epitomizing the lack of communication between North and South Korea. By asking North Korea to use the military communication lines on the West (Yellow) Sea to respond to the proposal about military talks and to use the liaison office at Panmunjeom to respond to the proposal about Red Cross Talks, Seoul expressed its intention to seize this opportunity to restore the lines of communication between North and South Korea.
Moon had previously stated that there are preconditions for inter-Korean dialogue, such as North Korea stopping its provocations and showing its willingness to denuclearize (the Berlin Declaration) or waiting for the right conditions to be in place (the South Korea-US summit). The statement by Unification Minister Cho Myung-gyun also included the phrase “if North Korea chooses the right path.” But such preconditions were not attached to the proposals for military talks and Red Cross talks. “The necessity of the right conditions being in place is our basic position in regard to North Korea’s nuclear weapons and missile provocations. The fact that we nevertheless proposed [talks] should be understood as being an early attempt to bring peace and ease tensions between North and South Korea in order to resolve urgent issues, including the divided families,” Cho said.
“The phrases that have appeared about ‘right’ or ‘appropriate’ conditions represent a cautious approach given the growing seriousness of the North Korean nuclear issue,” said Korea National Strategy Institute director Kim Chang-soo. “If inter-Korean dialogue bears fruit beginning with the military talks and the Red Cross talks, that would mean those conditions are forming. What President Moon is saying is that if that kind of atmosphere forms, he will engage in dialogue that can improve inter-Korean relations in a much fuller and more fundamental way.”
With Moon unveiling his North Korean policy just over two months into his presidency, experts are calling for Moon to devise his own approach that is distinct from those adopted by former presidents Kim Dae-jung (1998-2003) and Roh Moo-hyun (2003-08). At the moment, even the most basic channels of inter-Korean dialogue are severed. North Korea‘s nuclear weapons and missiles have become more threatening, and the international community has bolstered its cooperation on sanctioning and pressuring the North. During the nine-year hiatus in inter-Korean dialogue, North Korea has also gotten a new leader. This suggests that it would be difficult to resolve the issue simply by using the existing framework for inter-Korean relations.
“Both North and South Korea are deeply distrustful of each other,” said Inje University professor Kim Yeon-cheol. “Early on in the talks, it’s obvious that [both sides] will stick to their guns and test the other side’s resolve. But trust is not the condition for dialogue but its outcome. Once dialogue begins, trust is built from scratch through the process of dialogue.”
“In the future, there will no doubt be crises, major differences and obstacles resulting from various circumstances. Nevertheless, we need to keep open at least the two channels of military talks and Red Cross talks and build inter-Korean relations slowly, instead of rushing,” Kim added.",http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_northkorea/803296.html,hankyoreh
"North Korean celebrity defector ‘returns home,’ calling South a ‘capitalist hell’",7/19/2017," South Korea is investigating the case of a North Korean defector who became a celebrity refugee in Seoul, but recently appeared on Pyongyang television to claim she had returned home from the “hell” of the capitalist South.

Lim Ji-hyeon, a female defector in her 20s, arrived in Seoul in 2014 and soon became a public figure after starring in several South Korean TV shows featuring escapees from the North.

But on Sunday, Lim abruptly appeared in a video on the North’s propaganda network, describing how her “fantasy” about the wealthy South had been shattered.

In the video, posted on the North’s Uriminzokkiri website, Lim said she had “returned home” last month and was now living with her family in the western city of Anju.

It is unclear whether Lim returned voluntarily, with South Korean media speculating that she might have been kidnapped at the Chinese border with the North while trying to reunite with her family.

Police sources who probed Lim’s home and financial accounts in Seoul told the South’s JoongAng Ilbo daily there was little sign of her trying to wrap up her life in the country and move elsewhere.

“Relevant authorities are investigating the North Korean defector Lim Ji-hyeon,” said Lee Yoo-jin, deputy spokeswoman of Seoul’s Unification Ministry handling North Korea affairs. Seoul’s spy agency declined to comment.

In the video, Lim identified herself as Chon Hae Song, which she said was her real name in the North.

Wearing a traditional silk “hanbok” dress and red badge bearing the images of the North’s two former leaders, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, Lim tearfully detailed her “miserable” life in the capitalist neighbor, where “money is all that matters.”

“I went to South Korea harbouring this fantasy that I would able to eat and live well and make a lot of money there, but the South was not the place I imagined,” she said, adding she had wanted to become an actress in Seoul.

“Every single day in the South was like hell. Every night … I cried thinking about my motherland and my parents in the North,” she told her interviewers.

Lim also accused a South Korean TV station of pushing her to lie about her life in the North to make it sound more miserable than it actually was.

“Everything I said on TV was scripted … to make North Koreans look barbaric, ignorant and stupid,” she said, describing herself as “human trash” for defaming her motherland.

Other defectors who have reappeared in the North have been displayed on similar programs, prompting speculation they had been kidnapped or coerced into returning by threats to their families to serve Pyongyang’s propaganda.

Many defectors who reach the South hire brokers to take their remaining family out of the North through the border with China, and some even visit the Chinese border areas themselves — a dangerous move in a region monitored and frequented by North Korean agents.

More than 30,000 North Koreans have fled poverty and repression in the isolated homeland and settled in the South.

But many complain of lack of opportunities, discrimination and difficulty in adjusting to the cutthroat, ultracompetitive society.

A recent survey showed more than 60 percent of defectors consider themselves “low-class citizens,” with the average suicide rate among them at 15 percent — nearly three times the South’s national average, which is already the world’s highest.

Lee So-yool, another North Korean defector and TV celebrity in Seoul, however said Lim would have been broadcast criticizing the South regardless of whether she had returned to the North voluntarily or forcibly.

“She has to do it once she is back in the North. She has no choice in order to survive,” Lee said during a live YouTube broadcast Monday.

Lee said the North Korea-themed TV shows aired on South Korean TV — including ones that featured Lim — are hated by the Pyongyang regime for freely discussing issues that are taboos in the North.

“These TV shows let the refugees freely talk about things including the luxurious lifestyle of the ruling Kim family — which is totally banned in the North,” Lee said.",http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/07/19/asia-pacific/south-korea-investigating-north-korean-celebrity-defector-returned-home/#.WW-Q-YgrK00,japan_times
Moon seeks deal by 2020 for peace with nuclear-free North Korea,7/19/2017,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in is seeking a deal with North Korea in 2020 to bring about the “complete denuclearization” of the isolated nation in return for a peace treaty that would guarantee the survival of Kim Jong Un’s regime.

Moon, an advocate of dialogue and exchange with North Korea, set out his ambitious goal Wednesday in a special presidential Blue House report outlining his objectives for his five-year term. While the government this week proposed talks with Pyongyang, it’s the first time the new president has provided a timeline for his engagement policy.

“We will come up with a negotiation plan for comprehensive denuclearization that will lead a nuclear freeze to a complete dismantling,” of weapons, the Blue House said in the report, which stated Moon would propose a road map this year. “The treaty will be signed when denuclearization is complete and the peace regime will be maintained in a stable way.”

Moon, who took office May 10, is looking to ease tensions over Kim’s pursuit of a nuclear missile capable of striking the U.S. mainland. His Defense Ministry has offered talks with Pyongyang, while the National Red Cross has floated preparatory discussions for reunions of families split by the 1950-53 Korean War.

While his olive-branch approach doesn’t differ greatly from U.S. President Donald Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure and engagement,” the devil will be in the details, according to analyst Ralph Cossa.

“Moon apparently has Trump’s support in playing a lead role in dealing with the North,” Cossa, president of the Pacific Forum CSIS in Honolulu, said before the statement was released. “Both have agreed to a mix of pressure and dialogue but neither is an end in itself. The end is changing North Korea behavior, and the prospects of that remain very slim.”

Cossa added that Moon’s desire to take the lead on nuclear discussions is “a total no-starter” for Kim, who is seeking discussions with the U.S. as it is also a nuclear power. North Korea has signaled a willingness to consider Moon’s overtures, but has voiced skepticism about the prospects for a breakthrough.

On Saturday, North Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper criticized Moon’s approach as a “series of sleep-talking sophistries that create even greater hurdles” to talks. Still, the paper expressed “relief” that Moon has signaled a departure from the policies of his conservative predecessors.

The reclusive state has yet to respond to Moon’s demilitarization timetable.

North Korea is likely to agree to military talks by suggesting an alternative date and “there are a few easy carrots for Moon to offer, such as an end to propaganda broadcasts and balloons,” said Cossa. The sticking point is that Kim will want more than Moon can promise, such as an end to the South Korea-U.S. joint military drills.

Trump has also signaled his frustration with the pace of efforts by China, North Korea’s longtime ally and top trading partner, to pressure Kim back to the bargaining table. The stakes have risen for the U.S. president after North Korea’s first successful test July 4 of an intercontinental ballistic missile that analysts say could reach Alaska, if not continental America.

Wednesday’s report details 100 tasks that Moons plans to tackle during his single, five-year term. While they also cover areas such as the domestic economy and welfare policies, below are some of his objectives for relations on the Korean Peninsula:

Seek early return of wartime operational control to South Korea from the U.S.

Connect the two Koreas by building an energy belt along the east coast to Russia, a logistics and transportation belt on the west coast, and a tourism belt around the demilitarized zone on the border

Establishment of an inter-Korean joint market, if conditions allow, to boost private sector economic exchanges

Reopen the joint industrial park on the northern side of the border and resume tourist visits to North Korea’s Mount Geumgang — again, if conditions improve

Complete the nation’s three main defense systems earlier than scheduled in early-2020: Kill Chain, aimed at striking North Korea’s nuclear and missile system; Korea Air & Missile Defense to intercept North Korean missiles targeting South Korea; Korea Massive Punishment & Retaliation to remove the North’s leadership should it use nuclear weapons",http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/07/19/asia-pacific/politics-diplomacy-asia-pacific/moon-seeks-deal-2020-peace-nuclear-free-north-korea/#.WW-RBYgrK00,japan_times
"Kim’s North Korea gains a little economically, a lot militarily",7/16/2017,"Ruthless dictator? Economic reformer? Shrewd master of nuclear brinkmanship?

When Kim Jong Un took control of North Korea in late 2011, speculation swirled around the young, Swiss-educated leader. What would he do for an economically backward authoritarian nation that had been in a high-stakes nuclear standoff with its neighbors and Washington for years?

Almost six years later, there are still unanswered questions, but some things about Kim have come into focus. His rule has actually seen the economy improve, and when it comes to the nuclear drive, it’s obvious that Kim, who rattled nerves recently by test-firing his country’s first intercontinental ballistic missile, has a more uncompromising stance than his late father, Kim Jong Il, who occasionally sat down for talks with Washington meant to gain concessions.

Jong Un seems uninterested in negotiations until he perfects a nuclear missile capable of striking anywhere in the United States.

The stance has so far worked, and he’ll likely achieve the badly needed nuclear deterrence against the United States fairly soon if he’s not stopped.

Here’s a look at Kim’s nuclear gamble and what the future might hold.

In a different direction

His father, who ruled North Korea from 1994 to 2011, also ordered a series of weapons tests, but he let diplomats pursue now-dormant international disarmament-for-aid deals.

No such talks have happened under Jong Un. He has overseen three of the North’s five atomic test explosions and both of its successful satellite launches, which are seen by the U.N. as a disguised test of long-range missile technology.

And then there’s the July 4 ICBM launch, the North’s most successful missile test to date. Afterward, Kim said he will never put his nuclear and missile programs on the negotiating table as long as U.S. hostility and nuclear threats persist.

What accounts for Kim’s boldness?

It might just be his nature. Kim, believed to be around 33, may have strategically chosen to push the nuclear program after determining that the United States won’t attack because of fears that a North Korean retaliation would cause enormous casualties in South Korea.

Kim may also have determined that China, North Korea’s main ally and aid benefactor, might agree to tougher international sanctions against North Korea but would stop short of doing anything to bring down Kim’s government, which could trigger a flood of refugees over their shared border and potentially a unified Korea with U.S.-allied Seoul in charge.

North Korea’s small yet gradual economic growth in recent years has also allowed Kim to focus on furthering his nuclear ambitions. His father, by comparison, resorted to outside handouts to feed many of his 24 million people after a devastating famine in the mid-1990s killed tens of thousands.

Nuclear is ‘treasured sword’

Kim’s propaganda machine argues that the nuclear deterrence is a “treasured sword” meant to cope with U.S. aggression.

“Kim doesn’t want to resolve issues through diplomacy. He’s just trying to protect himself by reinforcing his country’s military power,” said analyst Cheong Seong-chang at South Korea’s Sejong Institute.

Since his inauguration, Kim has not met any foreign leaders or traveled abroad. The most high-profile foreigner he has met: former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who regaled him with a rendition of “Happy Birthday” at an exhibition game during one of several trips to Pyongyang.

Kim has repeatedly promised to achieve Korean unification, and he likely thinks his nuclear bombs will deter U.S. involvement in the event of another war on the Korean Peninsula. “If North Korea demonstrates its ability to strike Washington and New York . . . and threatens to turn them into a sea of fire, the U.S. couldn’t easily enter a war,” Cheong said.

After perfecting a functioning ICBM, which could take a couple of years, Kim could push for talks to win big outside concessions in return for imposing a moratorium on nuclear and missile activities. Even so, he won’t likely give up his already-developed weapons.

In the event of such talks, Kim would likely want big aid packages, the suspension of annual U.S.-South Korean military drills that North Korea views as an invasion rehearsal, and the signing of a peace treaty officially ending the 1950-53 Korean War, which would allow him to push for the withdrawal of the 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea.

Establish absolute power

Kim’s dogged quest for nuclear weapons may also relate to his hunger to be seen by his people as a strong leader and to establish the same absolute power held by his father and his grandfather, national founder Kim Il Sung.

This would make it hard for him to back off.

“He cannot give up nukes because they are the core of his power,” said Cho Han-bum, an analyst at South Korea’s Korea Institute for National Unification.

The North Korean ICBM could be capable of reaching Alaska, but weapons experts say the North still needs to master several more technologies before the missile will work perfectly.

When that happens, the United States might reconsider military strikes so as not to let other rogue states think they could get their own nuclear programs if they simply hold out, Cho said.

Aside from a U.S. attack, the most painful measure against North Korea could be a Chinese suspension or drastic scaling back of its oil shipments to the North.

China sends about 500,000 tons of crude oil to North Korea, mostly for free, every year. That accounts for 80-90 percent of the North’s domestic consumption, according to Cho Bong-hyun of Seoul’s IBK Economic Research Institute.

It’s not clear if China would suspend the shipments even if North Korea’s nuclear threat becomes more dangerous. But if a suspension happens, the North’s military, the backbone of Kim’s rule, would suffer because it cannot effectively fly warplanes and operate tanks without oil.

That will lead to Kim’s grip on power loosening, Cheong predicts.

“We can see he’s so far run North Korea in a smarter way than his father because the economic conditions have improved and the military power has been bolstered,” Cheong said. “But there is a high possibility that his adventurous, uncompromising attitude will eventually make things turn out badly.”",http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/07/16/asia-pacific/kims-north-korea-gains-little-economically-lot-militarily/#.WW-RF4grK00,japan_times
"North Korea may have more nuclear bomb material than thought, U.S. think tank says",7/15/2017,"Thermal images of North Korea’s main nuclear site show Pyongyang may have reprocessed more plutonium than previously thought that can be used to enlarge its nuclear weapons stockpile, a U.S. think tank has said.

The analysis published Friday by 38 North, a Washington-based North Korean monitoring project, was based on satellite images of the radiochemical laboratory at the Nyongbyon nuclear plant from September until the end of June, amid rising international concerns over North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs.

The think tank said images of the uranium enrichment facility at Nyongbyon could also indicate operation of centrifuges that could be used to increase North Korea’s stock of enriched uranium, its other source of bomb fuel.

There were signs too of at least short-term activity at North Korea’s Experimental Light Water Reactor that could be cause for concern, 38 North said.

The images of the radiochemical laboratory showed there had been at least two reprocessing cycles not previously known aimed at producing “an undetermined amount of plutonium that can further increase North Korea’s nuclear weapons stockpile,” something that would worry U.S. officials who see Pyongyang as one of the world’s top security threats.

It was unclear if the thermal activity detected at the uranium plant was the result of centrifuge operations or maintenance.

It said the thermal patterns at the plant’s isotope/tritium production facility suggested it was not operational and was therefore not producing tritium, an essential isotope used in boosted yield and hydrogen weapons.

North Korea manufactures atomic bombs using uranium and plutonium and has tested five nuclear bombs. Officials and experts say it could test a sixth at any time, despite U.S.-led international efforts to curb its program.

Pyongyang said its penultimate test in January 2016 was of a hydrogen bomb, something experts have treated with skepticism.

North Korea has been working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the United States and last week tested its first intercontinental ballistic missile, which experts said could hit all of Alaska and parts of the U.S. Pacific Northwest.

Frustrated that China, North Korea’s main trading partner, has not done more to rein in Pyongyang, the Trump administration could impose new sanctions on small Chinese banks and other companies doing business with Pyongyang within weeks, two senior U.S. officials said this week.

U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has been seeking to overcome resistance from China and Russia to a U.N. Security Council resolution imposing stiffer international sanctions on Pyongyang.

North Korea said Friday that it will take “corresponding measures” if the U.N. Security Council adopts another sanctions resolution in response to its ICBM test-launch.

The North’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement carried by the official Korean Central News Agency that the ICBM test was an exercise of its legitimate right to self-defense against nuclear threat from the United States.

Experts at 38 North estimated in April that North Korea could have as many as 20 nuclear bombs and could produce one more each month.",http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/07/15/asia-pacific/north-korea-may-nuclear-bomb-material-thought-u-s-think-tank-says/#.WW-T4IgrK01,japan_times
"North Korean ICBM ‘likely’ to be able to strike San Diego within two years, analysis says",7/11/2017,"North Korea’s new long-range ballistic missile will “likely” be able to strike targets on the U.S. West Coast — including San Diego — with a 500-kilogram nuclear warhead in the next one to two years, the U.S.-based monitoring group has said in an analysis.

The influential 38 North website, run by the U.S.-Korea Institute at Johns Hopkins University, said in the report released Monday that the North’s test last week of an intercontinental ballistic missile, the Hwasong-14, highlighted the isolated regime’s technological shortcomings — but also its advances.

While earlier reports said the ICBM could have traveled some 7,000-8,000 km if launched on a standard rather than “lofted” trajectory, aerospace engineer John Schilling said in the analysis, adding that “it can probably do a bit better than that when all the bugs are worked out.”

At present, he said, it “would be lucky to hit even a city-sized target.”

But once the technology is refined, a missile carrying a 500-kg warhead could potentially hit targets up to 9,700 km away, according to Schilling’s projections.

“With a year or two of additional testing and development, it will likely become a missile that can reliably deliver a single nuclear warhead to targets along the U.S. west coast, possibly with enough accuracy to destroy soft military targets like naval bases” such as the one in San Diego, he wrote.

“The North Koreans won’t be able to achieve this performance tomorrow, but they likely will eventually,” he wrote, citing the missile’s re-entry vehicle as the primary challenge facing Pyongyang presently.

In a separate announcement Tuesday, South Korea’s spy agency disputed the North’s claim that it had mastered the re-entry vehicle technology on the Hwasong-14.

“Although North Korea claimed that (the missile’s) heat resistance was verified, whether it re-entered (the atmosphere safely) was not confirmed and the country has no relevant test facility, making it look like it has not secured the technology,” the South’s Yonhap news agency quoted the country’s National Intelligence Service as telling a parliamentary intelligence committee.

The technology is crucial for protecting a warhead from the intense heat encountered when a missile re-enters the atmosphere.

North Korean state media said after the launch that it had verified “all technical features of the payload of the rocket during its atmospheric re-entry, including the heat-resisting features and structural safety of the warhead tip.”

Washington has called the ICBM test “a new escalation of the threat to the United States,” Japan and South Korea, and U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said last week that “global action … to stop a global threat” was required.

For his part, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has said he will continue to dole out “gift packages” of missile and atomic tests in spite of growing international pressure.",http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/07/11/asia-pacific/north-korean-icbm-likely-able-strike-san-diego-two-years-analysis-says/#.WW-RSogrK00,japan_times
"Large quake off North Korea coast ‘not a nuclear test,’ report says",7/13/2017," An undersea earthquake off the coast of North Korea was not caused by a nuclear test, the South’s media reported Thursday.

The 5.9 magnitude quake struck about 190 km (120 miles) southeast of the reclusive state’s third-largest city, Chongjin, in the early hours of Thursday, according to the United States Geological Survey.

North Korea has staged five nuclear tests — including two last year — and has made significant progress in its missile capability under Kim Jong Un, who took power in 2011.

But the quake, which did not trigger a tsunami warning, was not caused by a nuclear test, Yonhap news agency reported USGS geophysicist John Bellini as saying.

“It occurred at 500 km below the seabed,” he told the agency.

“It’s a natural earthquake.”

"North Korean defectors down as reclusive nation tightens grip on border, Seoul says",7/12/2017,"The number of North Koreans escaping to the South declined sharply in the first half of this year as Pyongyang strengthened controls on its border with China, officials said Wednesday.

The Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) dividing the Korean Peninsula is one of the most heavily fortified places in the world, and almost all defectors to the South go to China first — where they still risk being repatriated if caught — and then on to a third country before traveling to the South.

In the six months to June, 593 people from the North entered South Korea, down 20.8 percent from the same period in 2016, statistics compiled by Seoul’s Unification Ministry showed.

As usual, most — 85 percent — were women. North Korean men who try to leave are likely to be rapidly identified as absent by their work units.

Pyongyang’s “tightened grip on the population and strengthened border controls add to the risks for potential defectors to take the plunge,” a ministry official said.

The Seoul-financed Korea Institute for National Unification said in a report that since late 2015, the North has been bolstering border controls and installing high-tension electric fencing along the Tumen River that forms the border with China.

A total of 30,805 North Koreans have fled to the South, many of them leaving during the famine years of the 1990s.

Arrivals peaked in 2009, but numbers have fallen more recently, with leader Kim Jong Un reportedly ordering crackdowns on defectors and tightened border controls after inheriting power from his father in 2011.",http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2017/07/12/asia-pacific/north-korean-defectors-reclusive-nations-tightens-grip-border-seoul-says/#.WW-RM4grK00,japan_times
The North Korean missile crisis,7/13/2017," On Jan. 2, then-U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, referring to North Korea’s effort to develop a nuclear weapon capable of reaching the United States, assured his Twitter followers, “It won’t happen!” But it has.

On July 4 — Independence Day in the U.S. — North Korea gave Americans an unwanted birthday present, successfully testing the Hwasong-14, an intercontinental ballistic missile that analysts say has the capacity to reach Alaska. All that is left now is for the North to miniaturize a nuclear warhead to be deliverable by such an ICBM — a milestone that is thought to be not more than a few years off.

The North’s latest ICBM test has transformed the theater of diplomacy and war in Asia, and possibly the world, as it implies a level of nuclear risk witnessed only once before, with the Soviet Union in 1962. Indeed, we are now witnessing a slow-motion repeat of the Cuban missile crisis. The question is whether today’s leaders will show the same level of strategic thinking that enabled U.S. President John F. Kennedy to defuse the threat in Cuba.

The Cuban crisis began on Oct. 16, 1962, when U.S. National Security Adviser McGeorge Bundy presented to Kennedy photographs showing that the Soviet Union, then led by Nikita Khrushchev, had placed on the island — just 145 km from Florida — ballistic missiles capable of launching nuclear weapons at major U.S. cities. Suddenly, the world was on the precipice of a nuclear exchange that could lead to global annihilation.

Kennedy moved quickly to discuss his options with key advisers and experts. Those deliberations were secretly recorded (known only by Kennedy and maybe his brother, Attorney General Robert Kennedy). The transcripts, released 35 years later in the book “The Kennedy Tapes,” reveal applied game theory at its best.

To secure the immediate removal of the Soviet missiles, the U.S. considered two main strategies: a naval blockade or an airstrike. Applying a form of reasoning common to game theory, Kennedy recognized the need to put himself in his opponents’ shoes — and the likelihood that his opponent was doing the same. He also considered earlier advice on nuclear strategy, which he had sought from some of the finest game theorists of the time, including Thomas Schelling, who would later win a Nobel Prize. He was mindful of the moral consequences of his moves. And he understood that, sometimes, a compromise can be superior to trying for total victory.

To capitalize on their “first-mover advantage” — the Soviets did not yet know that a U.S. reconnaissance plane had seen, much less photographed, the missiles — Kennedy and his advisers kept the threat to themselves for six days, revealing their discovery only when they were prepared to take action. On Oct. 22, Kennedy announced a naval blockade of Cuba.

The Soviet Union, also recognizing the risks of continued escalation, responded by proposing a compromise. Ultimately, the U.S. agreed to remove its own missiles from Turkey and Italy, in exchange for the removal of the Soviet missiles from Cuba. Neither side achieved total victory, but neither risked total destruction, either.

The North Korea crisis requires similar strategic thinking. Whether North Korea’s opponents have developed bigger weapons is no longer the issue. North Korea’s nuclear capabilities are sufficiently developed that threats of military action, or even an attack, will not bring about the desired outcome — namely, that North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons.

This is partly because, unlike the Cuban missile crisis, the North Korean crisis is a three-player game (at least). Like the U.S., China — North Korea’s neighbor, closest ally and biggest trading partner — has a major stake in the outcome.

Were the U.S. and its allies to attack the North, China — whose alliance with the country dates back to the Korean War — would probably jump to its northeastern neighbors’ defense. And China has the ability to escalate the war beyond Asia.

On the diplomatic front, it has often been suggested that China should use its considerable leverage to push North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons voluntarily. But it is not clear that China has the ability — or even the will — to do so. China fears that if the North’s abandonment of its nuclear weapons led to eventual Korean reunification, U.S. soldiers — of which there are now 28,500 in South Korea — would arrive at its doorstep.

As for North Korea, its leaders know that giving up their nuclear weapons, without safeguards, would be tantamount to suicide. They have in mind the fate of countries like Iraq, Libya and Ukraine. So, like in 1962, there is a need for a strategic solution. Unlike in 1962, however, that solution cannot take the form of a single trade-off, because North Korea already has extensive nuclear capabilities, which it would not be willing to abandon in one fell swoop.

Instead, as Rajan Menon and others have suggested, there is a need to pursue incremental action. The North would roll back its nuclear program by a certain increment, while the U.S. would withdraw a share of its forces from South Korea. Once both sides reached that milestone, they would begin to progress toward the next one, and so on. There may have to be guarantees that, even if the Korean Peninsula is eventually reunified, U.S. troops will not be stationed in the North.

The North Korea crisis is not a classic “hawk-dove game” — or a game of chicken, which Bertrand Russell famously used to analyze nuclear strategy — in which the side that makes an uncompromising commitment to aggression wins. The players in the North Korean nuclear game must pursue gradual de-escalation, characterized by mutual concessions. The U.S. may not like the idea of rolling back some of its military presence in such a pivotal region, but it should not forget what Kennedy knew: There is no victor in a nuclear war.",http://www.japantimes.co.jp/opinion/2017/07/13/commentary/world-commentary/north-korean-missile-crisis/#.WW-RJ4grK00,japan_times
North Korea conducts new intercontinental missile test,28/07/2017,"North Korea has conducted a new intercontinental ballistic missile test, South Korea and the Pentagon say.
The missile reached an altitude of about 3,000km (1,865 miles) and landed in the sea off Japan, the Japanese national broadcaster NHK said.
It comes three weeks after North Korea's first ICBM test.
In response, the US and South Korean military conducted a live-firing exercise using surface-to-surface missiles, a US defence official said.
The missiles were fired into the ""territorial waters of South Korea along the east coast,"" a US military statement said.
The latest North Korean missile flew higher, further and for longer than the one in early July. Its launch has been condemned by a number of countries.
The test - the 14th carried out by North Korea in 2017 - is the latest to be conducted in defiance of a UN ban.
US President Donald Trump called it ""only the latest reckless and dangerous action by the North Korean regime"".
Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear nonproliferation expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, said that initial indications showed the latest missile had a range of about 10,000km - far enough to strike the west coast of the United States and beyond.
The Washington Post reported that Denver and possibly Chicago could now be in North Korea's range.
How the US might defend itself
Are Alaskans scared of Kim Jong-un?
The latest missile was launched at 23:41 (15:41 GMT) from an arms plant in Jagang province in the north of the country, the Pentagon said.
It is unusual for North Korea to launch a missile at night - the significance is as yet unclear. No missiles had been fired from Jagang province before, indicating a previously-unknown launch site is operational.
Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said the missile flew for about 45 minutes - some six minutes longer than the ICBM tested in early July.

NHK said it reached an altitude of about 3,000km - about 200km higher than the previous ICBM. It landed about 1,000km from the launch site, the Pentagon said.
ICBMs can reach altitudes well outside the earth's atmosphere. Using sharp trajectories with high altitudes allows North Korea to avoid firing over neighbouring countries.n the latest reaction:

Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe did the same, saying: ""The threat to Japan's security has become grave and real""
Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said: ""We remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation""
Despite ongoing tests, experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it on to a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target.
They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets.

""It is not yet clear how North Korean actors are leveraging virtual currencies, although targeting of these services demonstrates definite interest.""
North Korea is also reported to be mining the virtual currency Bitcoin.
Fireye said that such currencies were attractive to criminals because they could be traded in relative anonymity, compared with currencies that are managed and tracked by central banks. New hacking group

North Korea's missile programme
On Friday, North Korea test-fired a second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), claiming it proved that the entire US was within striking range.
The launch came three weeks after the state's first ICBM test.
Despite fierce objections from China, the US military recently began installing missile defences - the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (Thaad) system - in South Korea, with the aim of shooting down any North Korean missiles fired in conflict. On Sunday, the US military said a test of the Thaad equipment in Alaska had successfully brought down a projectile fired by the US Air Force over the Pacific.
US B-1 bombers also conducted exercises over the Korean peninsula with South Korean and Japanese planes on Sunday.
'Spoiled child'
US President Donald Trump has again criticised China for not doing enough to stop Pyongyang's weapons programme while making ""hundreds of billions of dollars"" in trade with the US.
Mr Trump wrote on Twitter that he was ""very disappointed"" with China, adding that he would not allow it to ""do nothing"" about the isolated state.
Victor Gao, a former diplomat and Chinese government adviser, said Mr Trump's comments were unhelpful, adding that the US was acting like a ""spoiled child"". China, which shares a land border with North Korea and is its closest economic ally, earlier condemned the North's test launch and urged restraint on all sides.
Mr Trump and his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping discussed North Korea earlier this year, after which US officials said they were working together on ""a range of options"".

China also condemned the missile test but urged ""all parties concerned"" to exercise restraint ""and avoid intensifying tensions"". Pyongyang said the launch had ""successfully tested re-entry capabilities"" of the missile.
Kim Jong-un ""said proudly the test also confirmed all the US mainland is within our striking range,"" the Korean Central News Agency said.
The statement said that the rocket was a Hwasong-14, the same model North Korea tested on 3 July.
Is ICBM test a game-changer?
What the outside world can do
The North has repeatedly tested missiles in breach of UN resolutions.
ICBMs can reach altitudes well outside the earth's atmosphere. Using sharp trajectories with high altitudes allows North Korea to avoid firing over neighbouring countries.
Despite the ongoing tests, experts believe the North does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it on to a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target.
Others, however, believe that at the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon within five to 10 years that could strike the US.
Within minutes of the launch, South Korean, Japanese and US officials reported data about the location, range, apogee, and flight time of the missile. While full analysis has not been finalised yet, several points stand out.
First, the data available indicates that the missile may have a range of approximately 10,400km. Since this missile is road-mobile, a launch from the north-eastern city of Rason would put New York City in range of the ICBM.
Second, the US reported that North Korea launched the ICBM from Mupyong-ni, North Korea. This location was different from many press accounts leading up to the launch which predicted a Kusong launch. The missile launched at 23:11 local time, an unusual time for North Korea's tests as well. It is possible that North Korea is already experimenting with deploying the missile under the cover of night or setting up multiple launch sites to confuse observers.

Mr Warmbier travelled to North Korea with Young Pioneer Tours. He was arrested in 2016 for trying to steal a propaganda sign and sentenced to 15 years in prison. He was returned to the US in a coma in June and died a week later.
How did the news come to light?
Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours, who both operate in North Korea, revealed on Friday that they had been told of the upcoming ban by the Swedish embassy, which acts for the US as Washington has no diplomatic relations with Pyongyang.
Rowan Beard, of Young Pioneer Tours, told the BBC the embassy was urging all US nationals to depart immediately.
He said the embassy was trying to check on the number of US tourists left in the country.
What form will the ban take?
Ms Nauert's statement said: ""Due to mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea's system of law enforcement, the Secretary has authorised a Geographical Travel Restriction on all US nationals' use of a passport to travelling through, or to North Korea.
""Once in effect, US passports will be invalid for travel to, through, and in North Korea, and individuals will be required to obtain a passport with a special validation in order to travel to or within North Korea.
""We intend to publish a notice in the Federal Register next week.
""The restriction will be implemented 30 days after publication.""
Rowan Beard said that the 30-day grace period would ""give leeway for any [Americans] currently in the country as tourists or on humanitarian work"".
How have the travel agencies reacted?
Simon Cockerell of Koryo Tours told the BBC the agency would still conduct tours and take Americans until the ban came into effect. ""If their country allows them to go, we will take them,"" he said.
Mr Cockerell added: ""It's unfortunate for the industry but also for North Koreans who want to know what Americans are really like.""
After the death of Mr Warmbier, the China-based Young Pioneer Tours announced it would no longer take visitors from the US to the country.
Why now?
There has been movement towards a ban for a while in the US, which increased with the Warmbier death.
In May, two congressmen introduced the North Korea Travel Control bill to cut off the foreign currency the country earns from American tourists.
The House foreign affairs subcommittee is scheduled to take up the draft legislation on 27 July but it would still have to go to the Senate. So there could be an executive order.
Apart from the treatment of Americans in North Korea, tension has been increasing over Pyongyang's nuclear programme. This month North Korea announced it had successfully tested what it said was its first intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), the latest in a series of tests in defiance of a UN ban.
Its range has been disputed, but some experts said it could reach Alaska.
The US and South Korea then conducted a ballistic missile drill and issued a stark warning to the North.
Some are suggesting the US is using the date the ban is set to be announced - 27 July - to cloud North Korea's Victory Day on the same day.
How many Americans will it affect?
North Korea only relaxed its rules for American visitors in 2010.
The state department does not keep a record of the number of American tourists.
Tour operators suggest that up to 1,000 visit every year.
What happened to Otto Warmbier? Otto Warmbier, 22, was an economics student who was arrested on 2 January 2016 and confessed to trying to take a propaganda sign from a hotel.
He was sentenced to 15 years of hard labour.
In June, North Korea said he had been in a coma for a year after contracting botulism.
He was flown back to the US on 13 June but died a week later without regaining consciousness.
His family rejected North Korea's version of events, saying he had been subjected to ""awful torturous mistreatment"".
Are there any Americans still being detained?
Yes. There are reported to be three US citizens in custody:
Kim Dong-chul, a 62-year-old naturalised US citizen born in South Korea, who was sentenced to 10 years of hard labour in April 2016 for spying
Korean-American professor Kim Sang-duk (or Tony Kim) who was detained in April 2017. The reasons for his arrest are not yet clear
Kim Hak-song, like Kim Sang-duk, worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology (PUST) and was detained in May 2017 on suspicion of ""hostile acts"" against the state

"North Korea: US not seeking regime change, says Rex Tillerson",2/8/2017,"The US government is not seeking a regime change in North Korea, the secretary of state says, amid tensions over Pyongyang's weapons programme.
""We're not your enemy,"" Rex Tillerson said, adding that the US wanted a dialogue at some point.
But a Republican senator said President Donald Trump had told him there would be a war with North Korea if its missile programme continued.
Pyongyang claimed its latest missile could hit the US west coast.
The second test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on Friday, celebrated by North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, was the latest to be conducted in defiance of a United Nations ban. ""We do not seek a regime change, we do not seek the collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula, we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel,"" said Mr Tillerson, referring to the border between the Koreas.
""We're not your enemy, we're not your threat but you're presenting an unacceptable threat to us and we have to respond.""
Analysis: No good options and little time
Barbara Plett Usher, US state department correspondent
North Korea's recent long-range missile tests have deepened concern about the threat Pyongyang poses to the US mainland, and strengthened determination here to prevent any strike. That's what the president had in mind in his war talk with Senator Lindsey Graham.
The Pentagon has updated military options, but at the same time says a confrontation would be catastrophic. In light of that, Mr Tillerson repeated at length that the US wasn't seeking regime change and said the goal was dialogue, but one not based on the assumption that North Korea could keep its nuclear weapons.
Pyongyang has categorically refused such terms.
The strategy, said Mr Tillerson, is a sustained campaign of peaceful but intensifying economic pressure to change its mind. But given the advances in ballistic technology demonstrated by the recent ICBM tests, there's growing doubt that denuclearisation is a realistic possibility.
As always, there are no good options when it comes to North Korea, but less time to pursue them.
How the US might defend itself
How dangerous are North Korea's missiles?
President Trump has repeatedly criticised China, which shares a land border with North Korea and is its closest economic ally, for not doing enough to stop Pyongyang's weapons programme.
However, Mr Tillerson took a more diplomatic approach, saying that ""only the North Koreans are to blame for this situation"".
""But,"" he added, ""we do believe China has a special and unique relationship, because of this significant economic activity, to influence the North Korean regime in ways that no one else can."" n a separate development, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said that Mr Trump told him that there would be a military conflict between the two countries if Pyongyang continued with its aim to develop a missile programme with the US in its range.
What the outside world can do
""There will be a war with North Korea over their missile programme if they continue to try to hit America with an ICBM,"" Mr Graham said.
""He [Trump] has told me that, I believe him, and if I were China I would believe him too, and do something about it,"" he said in an interview with NBC's Today programme.
Mr Graham added: ""If there's going to be a war... it will be over there. If thousands die, they're going to die over there. They're not going to die here. And he [Trump] has told me that to my face."" Despite the ongoing tests, most experts believe Pyongyang does not yet have the capability to miniaturise a nuclear warhead, fit it on to a long-range missile, and ensure it is protected until delivery to the target.
They say many of North Korea's missiles cannot accurately hit targets.
Others, however, believe that at the rate it is going, Pyongyang may overcome these challenges and develop a nuclear weapon within five to 10 years that could strike the US.",http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40797613,bbc
N.Korea Prepares Another Missile Test,26/07/17,"North Korea seems to be preparing another ballistic missile test this week, CNN reported Monday quoting a Pentagon official.
On U.S. military satellite images, ""transporter vehicles carrying ballistic missile launching equipment were seen arriving in Kusong, North Korea on Friday,"" it said.
Kusong is a launch site in North Pyongan Province. 
""The official said that when such equipment is seen, a launch could occur within six days,"" CNN added. This would coincide with July 27, the 64th anniversary of the armistice of the Korean War.
""Continuous movements of a launch vehicle have been detected in North Pyongan Province,"" a government source in Seoul also said on Tuesday. ""South Korean and U.S. military authorities are keeping and eye on the mobile launcher, which is capable of firing a missile anytime.""
Meanwhile, the U.S. is going to conduct another test of a THAAD missile interceptor that will be launched from the Pacific Spaceport Complex in Kodiak, Alaska on Saturday, according to the U.S. Missile Defense Agency. This will be a second such test since July 11.",http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/07/26/2017072601164.html,chosun_ilbo
Kim Jong-un Calls New Missile 'Gift to U.S. Bastards',6/7/2017,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un on Wednesday praised officials for sending a ""package of gifts"" to ""American bastards"" on their July 4 Independence Day with the test launch of what he claims was an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
The comment came from a report by the North's official Korean Central News Agency CNA and confirms that it meant to make a splash on the U.S. national holiday. 
It quoted Kim as saying that the Hwasong-14 missile ""looked as handsome as a good-looking boy and was well made"" and vowing never to give up his nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles until the U.S. ends its ""hostile policy"" against the North.  
KCNA said Kim flashed a ""broad smile"" and jokingly encouraged officials to ""frequently send big and small 'gift packages' to the Yankees."" 
He added that the drawn-out confrontation with the U.S. had reached its ""final stage."" He claimed the North's ""strategic position reached a new level through the possession of an atomic bomb, hydrogen bomb and intercontinental ballistic missile."" 
The state media report did not mention South Korea and only addressed the U.S. 
Yang Moo-jin at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul said, ""President Moon Jae-in said recently that South Korea wants to take the leading role in tackling problems on the Korean Peninsula, but North Korea has made it clear that it does not place much importance on Seoul. This was a message to the international community that the North and not the South has got the initiative.""

Surgical Strike on N.Korea 'Could Have Catastrophic Results',10/7/2017,"Experts have warned that any U.S. surgical strike on North Korea's nuclear and missile sites could have catastrophic consequences and lead ""to the worst kind of fighting,"" the New York Times reported last week.
A study by the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability in 2012 ""concluded that an initial artillery barrage by the North focused on military targets would result in nearly 3,000 fatalities, while one targeting civilians would kill nearly 30,000 people,"" the daily said.
U.S. military experts told the paper that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ""would only turn to such weapons if he needed to repel a full-scale invasion or felt a nuclear attack or other attempt on his life was imminent.""
It pointed out that the North has positioned as many as 8,000 artillery cannons and rocket launchers along the heavily fortified border between the two Koreas ""capable of raining up to 300,000 rounds on the South in the first hour of a counterattack"" and ""inflict tremendous damage without resorting to weapons of mass destruction.""
Early detection could result in North Korea losing about 20 percent of its artillery on the first day of fighting, but it would take three to four more days for the North's entire artillery arsenal to be decimated, it said.
That would mean massive damage in South Korea, because North Korea could focus its artillery attacks over a short period. According to the Nautilus Institute, 60,000 casualties could result from the first day of attack if the North focuses its artillery on military targets in the Seoul metropolitan area, with the casualty count surging to 300,000 if the artillery lands on civilian targets.",http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/07/10/2017071001112.html,chosun_ilbo
N.Korea Still Has Plenty of Cash to Buy Goods from China,11/7/2017,"China still exports plenty of essential goods to North Korea, whose purchasing power does not seem to have suffered significantly despite Beijing's ban on coal imports from the hermit country, the Financial Times reported Monday.
Coal accounts for 40 percent of the North's total exports. According to the UN, the North earned US$94 million a month on average from coal exports from early 2015 until 2016. 
It was therefore widely expected that the Chinese ban would deal a direct blow to the North's cash flow, but the North seems to have found ways round the ban either by smuggling or by selling the coal to Russia, the paper said. 
China Customs data shows that the North's exports to China dwindled from January until April this year, with exports in April about half of those in January. But they rebounded in May.
 
The North's imports from China, meanwhile, shrank only in February. ""But despite expectations that the move [the coal ban] would reduce Pyongyang's purchasing power, the value of Chinese exports to North Korea stayed strong in April and May,"" the FT pointed out. 
Major items are fuel, oil products, and coke for its steel mills.
Pyongyang's ""shopping list"" includes a number of petrochemical components and ingredients used in fertilizer or in motor fuel blending, a Chinese trader in Dandong told the FT. Its imports of cars, cooking oil, ship engines, oranges and tomatoes from China actually rose.
""It is also possible that North Korea continued to ship coal elsewhere, including Russia, and used the cash earned to continue to buy goods from the Chinese,"" the FT added. ""Any analysis of North Korea's domestic economy or of its true trade with China is partially a guessing game, because some data simply drop off. For instance, crude shipments have not been reported since 2013."" ",http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/07/11/2017071100809.html,chosun_ilbo
Magnitude 5.8 Earthquake Rocks N.Korea,14.7.17,"An earthquake of an estimated magnitude of 5.8 was detected off North Korea's eastern coast on Thursday.

It does not appear to have been caused by a nuclear test, Pentagon spokesman Jeff Davis told Reuters.

Kim Jong-un 'Wants Peace Treaty with U.S.',20.7.17,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has sent an ""urgent directive"" to diplomats to ""negotiate a peace treaty with the U.S.,"" Japan's Asahi Shimbun reported Wednesday. 
Sources told the daily that Kim considers South Korean President Moon Jae-in's term in office a ""golden opportunity"" to sign the peace treaty. The paper said Kim sent the directive to the North's overseas diplomatic mission during the G20 Summit in Germany from July 7-8, apparently emboldened by the successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
""The Moon Jae-in administration is providing a golden opportunity for us. Before hostile forces cause a stir, we must realize our duty of reunification,"" it quoted the directive as saying. 
The idea seems to be that Moon's desire for rapprochement offers North Korea a chance to drive a wedge between South Korea and the hardline Trump administration. That may be why the official Rodong Sinmun daily recently accused Moon of ""succumbing"" to the U.S. by maintaining sanctions against the North.
Seoul said it could not verify whether Kim had indeed sent the directive, but one government official said on condition of anonymity, ""North Korea has demonstrated it has an ICBM capable of striking the U.S and could try to use the weapon as leverage to ease sanctions.""
Meanwhile, the president's special advisor on North Korea policy, Moon Jung-in, admitted to Japan's Mainichi Shimbun that there is no room for South Korea as long as North Korea insists that the nuclear standoff involves only Pyongyang and Washington. 
But Moon added that the South could ""continue to exercise influence by recovering trust with North Korea"" and ""play a leading role in the resumption of stalled six-party talks.""",http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/07/20/2017072001520.html,chosun_ilbo
Fugitive N.Korean Family Kill Themselves in China,24.7.17,"A North Korean family of five, including a former senior official of the Workers Party, committed suicide last week after they were caught by Chinese police and faced deportation to the North. They were heading to South Korea.
Activist Kim Hee-tae told the Chosun Ilbo on Sunday, ""Fifteen defectors who were on their way to South Korea were caught by police in the Chinese province of Yunnan a week ago.""
""They killed themselves by taking poison after they were taken to Shenyang, Liaoning Province three days ago and faced deportation to the North,"" he added. They were a 50-something senior official of a regional agency of the Workers Party, his wife, son and two daughters.
""Right after they were caught in Yunnan, they tried to bribe their way out through a local fixer, but once they were taken to Shenyang they probably lost hope and killed themselves,"" Kim speculated.
The Foreign Ministry in Seoul declined to confirm the story.
Meanwhile, China appears to be cracking down more aggressively on refugees from the North. Twenty-seven defectors who were on their way to South Korea were arrested in Yunnan in July alone. Five others were caught in Guangxi near the border with Vietnam and 11 in Jilin Province, according to a source said.",http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/07/24/2017072401298.html,chosun_ilbo
N.Korea Responds Warily to Moon's Peace Overtures,17/7/17,"North Korea on Saturday gave its first official response to President Moon Jae-in's attempts at rapprochement, and it was largely scathing. 
The official Rodong Sinmun daily in an editorial said an initiative Moon laid out in Berlin two weeks ago ""is riddled with sophistries like sleep talking, which only pose hurdles rather than helping improve North-South relations."" 
But the daily added, ""It is a relief [Moon] takes a different stance from his predecessors and vows to honor the previous inter-Korean declarations,"" in 2000 and 2007. 
Moon's roadmap includes security guarantees as well as economic and diplomatic incentives if the North scraps its nuclear and missile programs, and it rules out the prospect of forced unification. 
But the paper accused South Korea of contradicting itself by pursuing peace while tightening sanctions and called on Seoul to implement ""a fundamental shift in policy and stance."" 
Still, the response was not quite as vociferous as in the recent past. ""The level of criticism was weaker than what we feared,"" a government official here said. ""If North Korea was completely uninterested in the Berlin initiative, it would have summed up its response in one word, but it didn't.""
Meanwhile, the government on Monday proposed military talks with North Korea this week to discuss halting military provocations along the heavily armed border to mark the 64th anniversary of the armistice on July 27 that ended the Korea War. 
If the North agrees to a meeting, it would mark the first official contact between the two sides in a year and seven months.
The Rodong Sinmun editorial said the ""first step"" the two Koreas need to take is to resolve the political and military standoff. A Unification Ministry official said, ""It looks like North Korea has sent us a message opening the doors for military talks.""
The Red Cross also proposed an inter-Korean meeting to discuss a reunion of families separated by the Korean War on Chusoek or Korean Thanksgiving Day on Oct. 4. ",http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/07/17/2017071701518.html,chosun_ilbo
N.Korea Can Field Intercontinental Nuke 'Within a Year',27.7.17,"The Pentagon believes North Korea can field a nuclear-capable intercontinental ballistic missile that could strike the U.S. mainland within a year, the Washington Post reported Tuesday.
The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency said there have been ""surprising technical advances"" in the North's recent missile tests. The assessment ""shaves a full two years off the consensus forecast for North Korea's ICBM program,"" the daily wrote.
The North on July 4 tested a Hwasong-14 ballistic missile can fly 7,000 to 8,000 km.
The DIA believes the North Korean regime can produce a ""reliable, nuclear-capable ICBM program"" sometime in 2018, the paper said. That means that ""by next year the program will have advanced from prototype to assembly line."" 
But the South Korean government and military disagree. They believe the North has not yet perfected atmospheric re-entry technology, a core point in ICBM development, and will still need two to three more years.
The National Intelligence Service told the National Assembly Intelligence Committee on July 11 that the North has not yet obtained the re-entry technology for nuclear warheads.
Mac Thornberry, the chairman of the House Committee on Armed Services, said on Tuesday that the U.S. has been negligent in missile defense over the past eight years and called for ""powerful and prompt"" measures to protect the U.S. and its allies.
Meanwhile, Washington is expected to conduct another THAAD interceptor missile test in Alaska on Saturday, the second since July 11.",http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/07/27/2017072700722.html,chosun_ilbo

N.Korea Snubs Old Partner Hyundai Group",28/7/17,"North Korea on Thursday declined a request from its old South Korean business partner Hyundai Group to visit and commemorate the late company chairman Chung Mong-hun.
The North's Asia-Pacific Peace Committee, an agency dealing with contacts with South Korea, notified Hyundai of the decision by fax. This is the first time the North has rejected Hyundai's request for a memorial service for Chung, who killed himself by jumping out of a window in 2003.
Hyundai executives led by his widow have held a memorial service at the North's Mt. Kumgang resort, which used to be run by subsidiary Hyundai Asan, almost every year since. But last year Hyundai did not make a request because inter-Korean relations were in the freezer after the North's latest nuclear test and the closure of the joint Korean Kaesong Industrial Complex.
Hyundai Group is a separate offshoot of the original conglomerate than the more famous Hyundai Motor.
Hyundai Asan applied for permission to visit the North to the Unification Ministry here on July 19. Two days later, it called and e-mailed the Beijing office of the North Korean committee to say it wants to hold the memorial service at Mt. Kumgang on Aug. 4. The North acknowledged receipt and promised to convey the request to the authorities.
Pyongyang has also snubbed other overtures from the new administration in Seoul and South Korean civic groups in recent weeks.
Hyundai Asan has traditionally served as a bellwether and messenger in contacts with the North, but this time there is clearly no appetite for renewed exchanges.
""Pyongyang is currently in hardline mode against Washington over the nuclear and missile issue and only interested in pressuring Seoul into suspending joint military drills with the U.S.,"" said Prof. Nam Sung-wook of Korea University.",http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/07/28/2017072801394.html,chosun_ilbo
Taps Turned off for N.Korea's Beer Festival ,25/7/17,"North Korea has abruptly canceled a beer festival that was to show the belligerent country's capital of Pyongyang in a fuzzier light starting Wednesday. 
The festival had been widely promoted by the state media and tour agencies, but apparently there was not enough to drink. 
Koryo Tours in China, which specializes in tours to North Korea, said on its blog on Sunday, ""Sadly today we have been informed that the 2017 Pyongyang Beer Festival has been canceled. The reason for the cancellation is unclear and we don't expect full information to be forthcoming but it is possibly down to the ongoing drought in the country that has caused a great deal of trouble."" 
The UN Food and Agriculture Organization said recently that North Korea is suffering its worst drought since 2001, and harvests have declined more than 30 percent compared to last year. 
But Unification Ministry spokesman Baek Tae-hyun here said Monday, ""This may be related to strengthened international sanctions.""  

The Pyongyang Beer Festival, modeled after Germany's Oktoberfest, was the brainchild of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The first was held in August last year and lasted about a month. 
At the time, North Korea's state television hailed the event as reflecting life in Pyongyang, ""a paradise on earth."" 
Foreign media also covered the event and evaluated the quality of North Korea's official Taedonggang beer. The beer was created in 2001, after then leader Kim Jong-il visited a Russian brewery and ordered his workers to develop a top-notch brew.  
North Korea bought a brewery in the U.K. and brought the equipment over to Pyongyang. In 2012, The Economist created a minor stir by saying Taedonggang ""tastes surprisingly good,"" and better than ""boring"" South Korean beer.",http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2017/07/25/2017072501045.html,chosun_ilbo
North Korea Tests a Ballistic Missile That Experts Could Hit California,28-Jul-17,"North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile on Friday that, for the first time, appeared capable of reaching the West Coast of the United States, according to experts — a milestone that American presidents have long declared the United States could not tolerate.

The launch, the second of an intercontinental missile in 24 days, did not answer the question of whether the North has mastered all the technologies necessary to deliver a nuclear weapon to targets in the lower 48 states. But just a few days ago, the Defense Intelligence Agency warned the Trump administration that the North would probably be able to do so within a year, and Friday’s test left little doubt that Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, is speeding toward that goal.

The missile launched on Friday remained aloft for roughly 47 minutes, according to American, South Korean and Japanese officials, following a steep trajectory that took it roughly 2,300 miles into space. It then turned and arced sharply down into the sea near the northernmost Japanese island, Hokkaido.

If that trajectory had been flattened out — a step the North may have avoided for fear of provoking an American military response — the missile could have put a number of major American cities at risk, experts say. The Pentagon was quick to declare that the “North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) determined the missile launch from North Korea did not pose a threat to North America.” That statement, while true, ignored the potential long-term implications of the launch.

“Depending on how heavy a warhead it carries, this latest North Korean missile would easily reach the West Coast of the United States with a range of 9,000 to 10,000 kilometers,” or 5,600 to 6,200 miles, said Kim Dong-yub, a defense analyst at the Institute for Far Eastern Studies at Kyungnam University in Seoul. “With this missile, North Korea leaves no doubt that its missile has a range that covers most of the United States.”

North Korea’s official news agency said Saturday that Kim Jong-un had called the test a “stern warning” to the United States. He also boasted that the North was “capable of the surprise launching of an intercontinental ballistic missile at any time and from anywhere and that all of the mainland United States is within the range of our missiles.”

The United States has gone to extraordinary lengths — feeding flawed parts into the North Korean production system and mounting internet attacks to cause test failures — to slow North Korea’s missile program. A few hours before the test, Congress approved the latest round of sanctions to squeeze the North.

While there have been some tactical successes, they have not stopped the weapons program. And Mr. Kim, determined to show the United States that he would not waver from his goal, has stepped up the pace of testing. In his remarks on Saturday, Mr. Kim said that the threat of sanctions or military action against the North “only strengthens our resolve and further justifies our possession of nuclear weapons.”

In a break with past practice, the White House turned out a statement in the name of President Trump, but it made no mention of the distance the missile flew or its implications. It read like many of President Barack Obama’s and President George W. Bush’s statements at similar moments.

“By threatening the world, these weapons and tests further isolate North Korea, weaken its economy, and deprive its people,” Mr. Trump said. “The United States will take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the American homeland and protect our allies in the region.”

Mr. Trump hoped to end North Korea’s provocations with the help of China, and he thought he had an agreement with President Xi Jinping to pressure Mr. Kim. But over the past two months, Mr. Trump discovered, as his predecessors did, that the Chinese are more concerned about preventing the collapse of North Korea’s government, and the chaos that would ensue, than they are in trade and energy sanctions that might truly change its behavior.

On Saturday, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs condemned the North Korean missile test, but it also urged other countries to avoid responding in ways that could set off any tit-for-tat retaliation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/28/world/asia/north-korea-ballistic-missile.html,NYT
Defector to South Korea Who Became a Celebrity Resurfaces in the North,18-Jul-17," Until April, Lim Ji-hyun had been a modest television celebrity in South Korea, talking to the audience about the country she knew best: North Korea. She even had her own online fan club, indicating that she was among the relatively few North Korean defectors who had successfully adjusted to life in the capitalist South.
This week, Ms. Lim resurfaced in North Korea, tearfully recalling a terrible life in the South.
“Every single day of my life in the South was a hell,” Ms. Lim, 26, said in a videotaped interview uploaded on the North Korean government-run propaganda website Uriminzokkiri. “When I was alone in a dark, cold room, I was heartbroken and I wept every day, missing my fatherland and my parents back home.”
Ms. Lim — or Jeon Hye-sung, as she was called in the North — said she returned to “the bosom of the fatherland” last month and was now living with her parents in her hometown.
She did not reveal how she traveled back to the North. The Unification Ministry, the South Korean government agency that handles issues related to defectors, said it was investigating Ms. Lim’s case. Since there is no press freedom in the North, what Ms. Lim told the propaganda website cannot be independently verified.
“I was lured to the South by a delusion that I would eat well and make a lot of money there,” she said. “It was not the place I had imagined. I had wandered around everywhere there to make money, working in drinking bars, but nothing had worked out.”
Since a famine struck their country in the late 1990s, more than 30,000 North Koreans have defected to the South, a vast majority of them taking a perilous journey through China and the jungles of Southeast Asia to seek new lives.
After an extensive debriefing, they go through a monthslong program intended to help them integrate into South Korean society. But they often find it hard to make the transition from the North’s highly regimented totalitarian system to the South’s fast-paced, hypercompetitive capitalist society. They often cannot catch up with South Korean peers in schools and workplaces. Their strong accents divulge their origin.

Usually toiling in jobs shunned by South Koreans, they save money, which they send to family members left behind in the impoverished North.

North Korea used to call defectors “traitors” or “human scum.”

But since the North’s young leader, Kim Jong-un, took power in 2011, at least 25 defectors have resurfaced, claiming that they returned voluntarily, fed up with life in the South.

South Korean officials agree that some of the North Koreans may have returned out of desperation after failing to adjust to life in the South. But they also suspect that some were abducted back to the North after they were lured to China. North Korean agents have tried to blackmail defectors in the South, using their relatives in the North as hostages, they said.

The returning defectors are a propaganda boon for Mr. Kim.

His government has organized news conferences in Pyongyang, where the returnees claimed that human smugglers or South Korean spy agents cheated or kidnapped them to the South. They invariably thanked Mr. Kim for giving traitors like them a second chance. The United Nations has long criticized North Korea as one of the world’s worst human rights violators.

Under Mr. Kim, the North has tightened control along the border with China, the main escape route for defectors. The number of North Korean refugees arriving in the South dropped to 1,418 last year from 2,706 in 2011, according to the Unification Ministry. It has also intensified the crackdown on South Korean movies and TV dramas smuggled from China through which North Korean defectors said they learned of life in the South.
“In the South, where money ruled, there was only physical and psychological pain waiting for people like me who had betrayed their fatherland and fled,” Ms. Lim said in an apparent warning to North Koreans who might be dreaming of leaving for the South.
Ms. Lim arrived in South Korea in 2014.
From December, she had been among scores of mostly young female North Korean defectors who have tried to build careers on cable TV talk or reality shows. They often appear in North Korean dresses and sing North Korean songs.

Speaking in their unmistakable North Korean accents, these women share often funny or tearful episodes of life in the famine-struck Stalinist state or their dangerous journeys for freedom. A show called “Love of South and North” matches North Korean women with South Korean men, placing them in a romantic situation.

These entertainment-driven programs, which often advertise “beauties from the North,” are accused of airing sensational yet unconfirmed allegations from the defectors. But they are also credited with helping South Koreans understand the lives of ordinary people in the North, a neighbor that has seldom generated interest among South Koreans despite its growing nuclear and missile threats.

On the talk show Moranbong Club on TV Chosun, a cable channel, in December, Ms. Lim appeared in a North Korean military uniform and cheerfully described how she used to bribe her teacher with a pack of cigarettes so that she could skip classes and sell smuggled bottles of liquor to make money.

Back in North Korea, she said she and other defectors on South Korean TV shows were often coerced into slandering the North — an allegation the channels deny.

In a separate reality show, Ms. Lim showed how to climb trees and make fire in the woods, skills she picked up while serving in a North Korean military artillery unit.

While pursing her TV career, Ms. Lim lived in a small one-room studio in Seoul. In her fan blog in March, she said she got busier because she just enrolled in a school, uploading photographs of her doing homework, according to the South Korean daily JoongAng Ilbo.

In April, she thanked her fans for a birthday party, calling it “possibly the happiest birthday of my life.”

Soon afterward, she disappeared.

UN agency Reports Worst Drought in 16 Years in North Korea,21-Jul-17,"North Korea is suffering its worst drought in 16 years, a United Nations agency reported on Friday, raising fears of worsening food shortages in the country, where children and other vulnerable groups have been malnourished for years.

North Korea’s production of staple crops for this year, including rice, corn, potatoes and soybeans, has been severely damaged by prolonged dry spells “threatening food security for a large part of its population,” the agency, the Food and Agriculture Organization, said in a report prepared in collaboration with the European Commission’s Joint Research Center.

Seasonal rainfall in the main cereal-producing regions is below that of 2001, when grain production fell to a record low of two million tons, Vincent Martin, the agency’s representative in North Korea, said in a news release.

Although some rain has fallen this month, it was likely to be too late to allow the normal planting and development of main crops that would be harvested in October and November, the report said.

Because of the drought, the production of early season crops that are harvested in June, including wheat, barley and potatoes, dropped to 310,000 tons, more than 30 percent below last year’s 450,000 tons, it said. The early season harvest usually accounts for 10 percent of the country’s total annual cereal production.

“Increased food imports, commercial or through food aid, would be required during the next three months at the peak of the lean season, ensuring adequate food supply for the most vulnerable, including children and elders,” the agency said in a statement.

North Korea experienced chronic food shortages in the 1990s, when a famine caused by years of bad weather and economic mismanagement forced the country to issue a rare appeal for international help. By some estimates, more than a million people died in the famine.

The country has since allowed more market-oriented activities and encouraged trade with China to increase access to food. Its own food production has also improved in recent years. But humanitarian relief groups still call for donations, warning that shortages remain widespread.

But international donors have become increasingly reluctant to provide humanitarian aid in recent years, as North Korea has continued to test nuclear weapons and missiles in defiance of United Nations resolutions. In September, after the North’s fifth nuclear test, South Korea did not offer humanitarian aid to tens of thousands of flood victims in North Korea, saying that the country should divert the money spent on weapons to buy food for its people.

President Park Geun-hye took a hard-line stance on the North, but under President Moon Jae-in, a liberal who took office in May, the South Korean government has indicated it will be readier to consider humanitarian aid.
But North Korea did not appear to be helping itself. It has not responded to the South Korean proposal on Monday that the two sides hold military and humanitarian talks on the border to discuss easing tensions.
The South’s Defense Ministry had wanted to hold a military dialogue with the North on Friday. After receiving no response, it said it was willing to wait for several more days.
North Korea has not yet reported any damage from the drought. Instead, its main state-run newspaper, Rodong Sinmun, urged the country on Friday to produce more goods locally, especially raw materials and fuel, to overcome what it called “barbaric” international sanctions pushed by the United States.
In a separate commentary, the newspaper criticized Washington’s efforts to pressure China to use its economic leverage to force the North to abandon its nuclear and missile programs.
The American tactic will never break the Communist neighbors’ “friendly ties sealed in blood,” it said, referring to when China and North Korea joined to fight the Americans during the 1950-53 Korean War. The newspaper also warned that the Chinese would gain little if they succumbed to pressure from the United States and hurt their neighbor.
Despite United Nations sanctions, North Korea’s external trade grew by an estimated 4.7 percent to $6.55 billion last year, the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency, a government-invested organization in South Korea, said on Friday.
North Korea’s trade with China grew 6.1 percent to $6 billion last year, the agency said. China accounts for more than 90 percent of the North’s external trade.
Also on Friday, South Korea’s central bank, the Bank of Korea, said that the North Korean economy grew by about 3.9 percent last year. That was the highest annual growth rate the Bank of Korea has reported for the North in 17 years and was another indication that the economy there has been growing under its leader, Kim Jong-un.
Economists caution that it is difficult to offer reliable economic growth estimates for North Korea because it does not release its economic data. Analysts have often said the central bank’s estimates on North Korean economic growth are too conservative.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/world/asia/north-korea-drought-food-shortages-grain.html,NYT
Mapping the Brutality of North Korea and where the Bodies Are Buried,19-Jul-17,"For two years, from a cramped office in central Seoul, activists and volunteers from five countries have been doing something never tried before: creating interactive maps of places where North Korea is thought to have executed and buried prisoners.

Over the years, defectors from the isolated country have testified to widespread human rights violations there, including what United Nations investigators have determined were extrajudicial executions of political prisoners and others. But there has never been a coordinated attempt to locate where those killings took place because the country remains off limits to outside rights investigators.
On Wednesday, activists affiliated with the Transitional Justice Working Group, a human rights group based in Seoul, announced their initial findings, identifying more than 300 sites where executions are thought to have occurred and 47 sites believed to have hosted cremations and burials, places where as many as 15 people may have been executed and their bodies dumped together or left “like trash.”
“It is not unreasonable to assume that mass grave sites in existence today will still be there years from now,” said Sarah A. Son, the group’s research director. “As we have seen in many other post-conflict settings around the world, people will want to know what happened to family members, and an accurate historical record will need to be created as part of the process of recovery, particularly on a scale such as that in North Korea.”
Armed with Google Earth satellite imagery, the group has interviewed 375 North Korean defectors, asking them to help locate sites so that international rights officials can one day visit them to investigate, exhume bodies, secure forensic evidence and possibly bring charges against perpetrators. With the maps, the group said it aimed to provide “a sense of the scale of the human rights violations, their locations, and their victims and their approximate numbers.”
“We don’t know when there will be a trial or other steps to hold perpetrators of the human rights abuses accountable, but that time will come, and we want to be as ready as possible,” said Dan Bielefeld, a web developer and human rights activist from Milwaukee. “Our location-based map of suspected sites is a start down that road.”
The activists said they were inspired by the United Nations’ commission of inquiry, which in 2014 reported prison camps, systematic torture, summary executions and other widespread rights violations in North Korea.

The report led United Nations member states to adopt a resolution asking the Security Council to refer the North Korean leadership to the International Criminal Court in The Hague, for prosecution of possible crimes against humanity.

The North vehemently denied the findings, and its allies China and Russia have stalled any attempt to bring the North before the tribunal.

The activists’ group, whose mapping project was financed by the National Endowment for Democracy, based in Washington, did not include the interactive maps in its report for fear North Korea would tamper with the sites. But it allowed a reporter to examine them on the condition that the locations of the sites would not be revealed.

More than 200 locations where killings are suspected, marked with blue squares, were clustered in Hamgyongbukdo, a northeastern province of North Korea. Most of the defectors interviewed hailed from that province. (A vast majority of 30,000 North Korean defectors living in South Korea come from the provinces bordering China.)

When Mr. Bielefeld zoomed in on one town, 53 blue squares appeared within 2.5 miles of a hillside site where burials are suspected. When he clicked on a square, a brief summary popped up: a public execution by firing squad on charges the victim stole parts of mining equipment. The victim was shot by three officers from the Ministry of People’s Security.

Each square was linked to digital testimonials, including audio files, from defectors. Some testimonials gave detailed firsthand accounts with the name and profession of the victim, while others relied on secondhand information.

In one testimonial, a defector cited a neighbor who saw security officers hacking a victim to death in a garage. The neighbor later confirmed from a relative working as a security officer that such extrajudicial killings were common in the garage. Mr. Bielefeld put a blue square on the building on his program based on the open-source OpenStreetMap.

The group said North Koreans were executed for such crimes as smuggling mushrooms to China, stealing copper from factories, distributing South Korean dramas, human trafficking and “a slip of the tongue,” usually a reference to criticism of the government.

It said public executions took place most often between 1994 and 2000, during which North Korea struggled to control its people, who were suffering in a nationwide famine.

“They hanged people in crowded places like markets and left the bodies there for hours to instill fear among the people,” said Oh Se-hyek, a North Korean defector who conducted the interviews for the mapping project.

Mr. Oh said the biggest challenge for him was to persuade other defectors to testify for the mapping project, even when he promised not to reveal their personal information. Even after resettling in South Korea, defectors feared that the North Korean authorities would trace their whereabouts and retaliate against their relatives back in the North.

Some of the executions on the digital maps dated from the 1960s, but some were as recent as 2015. As many as 15 people were executed at the same time, usually by firing squad.

Lee Young-hwan, executive director of the Transitional Justice Working Group, recalled the shock he felt when he was a college student doing volunteer work with North Korean defectors in 1999. During a painting class, a 7-year-old boy from the North depicted a scene he saw in his old homeland: uniformed North Korean soldiers executing people by shooting.

Encouraged by the 2014 United Nations report, Mr. Lee began putting together the international team to use satellite imagery and open-source mapping technology to record North Korean human rights violations, just as security analysts use such technology to monitor the North’s military and nuclear sites.

“As we interview more defectors down the road, we expect to locate more killing and burial sites across the North,” Mr. Lee said. “Our work is still at an early stage. This is a collaborative work, and we expect more technical and other volunteers to join us.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/world/asia/north-korea-execution-sites.html,NYT
"U.S. Opens Door to Talks With North Korea, While Flexing Military Muscle",2/8/2017," In the Trump administration’s first serious attempt at a diplomatic opening to North Korea, Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson has offered to open negotiations with Pyongyang by assuring “the security they seek” and a new chance at economic prosperity if the North surrenders its nuclear weapons.

Mr. Tillerson’s comments came just hours before the United States on Wednesday tested an unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile, sending it 4,200 miles to a target in the Marshall Islands. The Pentagon said the test was not intended as a response to the North’s launch on Friday of a missile that appeared capable of reaching Los Angeles and beyond.

But military officials said the test demonstrated that the American nuclear arsenal was ready “to deter, detect and defend against attacks on the United States and its allies.”

The combination of Mr. Tillerson’s outreach and the missile test laid bare an internal administration debate over what course to take — and whether a combination of diplomatic outreach and maximal military pressure would change North Korea’s current course. Most intelligence assessments have concluded that the North has no incentive to begin negotiations until it demonstrates, even more conclusively than it has in recent weeks, that its nuclear weapon could reach the United States mainland.
The missile test was the latest demonstration of American power to North Korea. Over the weekend, the United States flew two strategic bombers over the Korean Peninsula, alongside fighter jets from South Korean and Japan. And for years, with mixed results, the United States has targeted the North’s missile program with cyberattacks.
Trump administration officials said Mr. Tillerson was increasingly concerned that the recent North Korean advances, especially its missiles’ range, were driving the United States to a binary choice: Accept a North with nuclear weapons that can target American cities, or head toward a military confrontation.

At a rare appearance in front of the State Department press corps on Tuesday, Mr. Tillerson went out of his way to offer assurances to the government of Kim Jong-un in Pyongyang. Others in the Trump administration have declined to publicly say as much, and on Wednesday night, The Wall Street Journal reported that Vice President Mike Pence told journalists traveling with him on Air Force Two that the United States would not hold direct talks with North Korea. It was not clear how his comments squared with those of Mr. Tillerson a day earlier.

“We have reaffirmed our position toward North Korea,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters. “We do not seek a regime change, we do not seek the collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula, we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel,” which divides North and South, he said.
“And we’re trying to convey to the North Koreans: We are not your enemy, we are not your threat,” he said. “But you are presenting an unacceptable threat to us, and we have to respond.”
That was a somewhat different tone than the one Mr. Tillerson took when he visited Seoul in March and appeared to make North Korea’s surrender of nuclear weapons a prerequisite for talks. At that time, he said that negotiations could “only be achieved by denuclearizing, giving up their weapons of mass destruction,” and that “only then will we be prepared to engage them in talks.”

The idea that North Korea would give up its weapons at the opening of talks was dismissed immediately by allies as unworkable, and Mr. Tillerson may have simply phrased it badly. But the question now, after a series of successful missile tests, is whether Mr. Kim will decide it is time to negotiate a “freeze” on further detonations and launches — or whether he should just keep going on his current path.

Even Mr. Tillerson has, in the past, cast doubt on the wisdom of entering a “freeze,” since it would essentially enshrine North Korea as a de facto nuclear weapons state — to which a series of American presidents have said they would never agree.
Mr. Tillerson’s new position is that negotiations should begin without conditions, as long as they are ultimately headed toward denuclearization. “We don’t think having a dialogue where the North Koreans come to the table assuming they’re going to maintain their nuclear weapons is productive,” he said on Tuesday. “So that’s really what the objective that we are about is.”

Outside experts had their doubts about whether the North would take up Mr. Tillerson’s offer.

Christopher R. Hill, a former American ambassador to Seoul who led Bush-era negotiations on ending North Korea’s nuclear program, said on Saturday that Pyongyang believed the United States was cornered into accepting it as a nuclear weapons state. “We are left in a situation where they believe we will ultimately acquiesce,” he said at the KentPresents ideas festival in Kent, Conn.

At the same conference, Kathleen Stephens, another former American ambassador to Seoul, said in the case of China, India and Pakistan, “we have never succeeded in stopping a nuclear aspirant country.” She also said the North’s drive for a weapon was based on a bet that the United States could not stop it.
But in making the offer to talk, Mr. Tillerson may be accomplishing several goals at once.
If the North rejects the proposal, Washington can reiterate its good-faith effort to the Chinese and a new South Korean government that has proposed its own negotiations with North Korea — and then step up military and financial pressure. If the North insists, as it has in the past, that it must first be recognized as a nuclear weapons power, the United States can make the case that the ultimate objective — a denuclearized Korean Peninsula — cannot be achieved diplomatically.
Mr. Tillerson’s offer also nods toward other diplomatic proposals. China has suggested a “freeze-for-freeze” deal, in which the United States agrees to halt all military exercises with South Korea — something Mr. Hill noted would “hollow out the alliance” — in return for North Korea’s stopping its tests.
Both sides have rejected that idea, but it creates an opening.
“If we can get past the impasse of the North Koreans saying, ‘We will only come to the table if you recognize us as a nuclear state,’ and the U.S. saying, ‘We can only enter into talks if you commit to denuclearization,’ there’s a diplomatic space,” said Robert S. Litwak, director of security studies at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington, and author of “Preventing North Korea’s Nuclear Breakout.”
Mr. Litwak advocates a freeze deal that he said would “at least stop us from having to deal with a North Korea with 100 nuclear weapons, instead of 20 or so” — the current estimate of the size of its arsenal.
But if a freeze is all that is achieved, North Korea essentially becomes like Pakistan: a nuclear power that the United States does not formally recognize, but has to deal with as a real weapons state.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/us/politics/tillerson-north-korea-negotiations-missile-test.html,NYT
U.S. Tests Unarmed Intercontinental Ballistic Missile,2/8/2017,"The Pentagon conducted a test of an unarmed intercontinental ballistic missile on Wednesday, with the timing expected to be of note in both North Korea, which recently tested its missile arsenal, and in China, which has been urged by the Trump administration to pressure North Korea on its nuclear program.
The test came a day after Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson said that the United States was not seeking a regime change in North Korea and would be willing to talk to Pyongyang.

“We do not seek a collapse of the regime, we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula, we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th Parallel,” Mr. Tillerson told reporters at the State Department on Tuesday. Mr. Tillerson assured North Korea “we are not your enemy,” but added that Pyongyang “is presenting an unacceptable threat to us and we have to respond.”
“We would like to sit and have a dialogue with them,” Mr. Tillerson said.
American intelligence agencies recently said that North Korea was developing a missile that could reach the interior of the United States in about a year.
“We’ll handle North Korea,” President Trump said on Monday before he met with his cabinet. “We’re going to be able to handle them. It will be handled. We handle everything.”
The unarmed Minuteman III intercontinental ballistic missile was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, according to an official statement from the Air Force Global Strike Command released early Wednesday after the test was completed.
“While not a response to recent North Korean actions, the test demonstrates that the United States’ nuclear enterprise is safe, secure, effective and ready to be able to deter, detect and defend against attacks on the United States and its allies,” the statement said.
The statement said the missile’s re-entry vehicle traveled about 4,200 miles over the Pacific Ocean to the Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The test was described as a way to “verify the accuracy and reliability of the ICBM weapon system, providing valuable data to ensure a continued safe, secure and effective nuclear deterrent.”",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/world/asia/united-states-tests-unarmed-intercontinental-ballistic-missile.html,NYT
Let’s Face It: North Korean Nuclear Weapons Can Hit the U.S.,3/8/2017,"It seems impossible to imagine the most impoverished, backward communist regime in Asia, run by a madman and recovering from a crippling famine, should set out to build a long-range missile that could deliver a nuclear weapon all the way to the United States. And yet Mao Zedong’s China did it.

In 1964, as today, Americans had trouble accepting the new reality of their vulnerability. United States officials were slow to realize that China was on the verge of testing a nuclear weapon that year, and later were surprised to learn that Beijing was not willing to settle for only short-range missiles that could strike neighbors like Japan. The scope of Mao’s ambition — to develop a thermonuclear weapon that could hit the United States — did not match American preconceptions of China. And so, collectively, we did not believe it.

Over the past few years, North Korea has made every possible effort to indicate that, like Mao’s China, it was committed to developing a nuclear-armed intercontinental range ballistic missile. Starting in 2014, North Korea began testing missiles at a much faster pace than before. Kim Jong-un, the country’s leader, began visiting defense industry plants all over the North, showing off newly built facilities and the new machine tools inside them. North Korea began releasing increasingly explicit pictures of its missile program, including some of new rocket engines and tests of the vehicle that would protect a nuclear weapon as it re-entered the atmosphere.

North Korea hasn’t been coy. It showed off new types of intercontinental ballistic missiles in parades in 2012, 2013 and 2015. In March 2013, North Korean state media released pictures of Mr. Kim approving a nuclear targeting plan, illustrated with a graphic of the United States titled “Mainland Strike Plan.” A handful of targets were identified, including San Diego, Calif., where the Pacific Fleet is based; Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana, where Air Force Global Strike Command is located, and Washington, D.C. In 2016, Mr. Kim posed with a shiny sphere, described as a North Korean nuclear warhead, placed next to an intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM.
After each of these displays, the first question any reporter would ask me was, “What message do you think the North Koreans are trying to send?”
Starting this year, North Korea became even more explicit. On New Year’s Day, Mr. Kim said his country had completed preparations to test an ICBM. In April, Pyongyang celebrated the birthday of North Korea’s late founder Kim Il-sung with a military parade that showed off a series of new missiles, as well as two different types of missile canisters that appeared designed for never-before-seen ICBMs. In early June, North Korean media commented on the distance to New York City, warning that a test of a missile that could reach it was “not a long way off.”
The United States’ collective response to the prospect of North Korean ICBM testing was summed up in the final sentence of an early January Twitter message from President-elect Trump: “It won’t happen!”
And now it has. Twice. The most recent test, on July 28, likely won’t be the last.
Over the past few years, Americans have told ourselves one reassuring story after another: China will solve this problem for us. We can use cyberattacks to hack North Korea’s missiles. We can shoot down test missiles. The missiles are fakes, or too small to carry a nuclear payload. North Korean scientists will encounter some problem, possibly with missile guidance or re-entry, that will stop them cold.
These were all examples of wishful thinking.
It was never inconceivable that North Korea would develop a nuclear weapon and put it on a missile. This is hardly new technology. While only a few countries have built ICBMs, that is because only a few countries have felt the need to deter threats from across the globe. Both the Soviet Union and China were able to establish sophisticated rocket programs even though they lagged behind the West in other sectors. Some early North Korean tests inevitably failed, but there was never reason to think that failures would stop North Korea when they did not stop others.
Why didn’t we see the warnings? The main problem, I suspect, is that we don’t know what to do. Our portrayals of North Korea are all too often caricatures of bellicosity and backwardness. American politicians and editorial writers are still talking about using force to overthrow Mr. Kim, as if he were Saddam Hussein of Iraq in 2003 and not a leader with a nuclear arsenal.

The reality is that the United States is now vulnerable to North Korea’s nuclear-armed missiles — and has no choice but to live with that reality. Trying to disarm a nuclear-armed North Korea would be madness, even if some politicians find that fact too emasculating to acknowledge. Since admitting our vulnerability is a humiliation, we simply close our eyes and pretend it isn’t real.

The United States did something similar after China’s first nuclear test. American officials repeatedly called China’s bomb a “device” — a euphemism mocked at the time by Tom Lehrer, the great satirist of the Cold War — and argued that there was no evidence China could mount it on a ballistic missile.
That skepticism was no different than the skepticism some officials and experts have expressed about North Korea today. The Chinese response was to alter its schedule of nuclear tests. In 1966, the Chinese placed a live nuclear weapon on a ballistic missile, and fired it across the country to China’s test site in the western desert, where it exploded with a force of more than 10 kilotons. After that, the United States stopped denigrating China’s nuclear weapons.
Let’s hope it does not come to that with North Korea.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/opinion/north-korea-nukes.html,NYT
Trump Blames Congress for Poor U.S. Relations With Russia,3/8/2017,"President Trump blamed Congress on Thursday for the United States’ poor relationship with Russia, a day after he signed sanctions legislation that he said was flawed and unconstitutional.
In a Twitter message, Mr. Trump described America’s relationship with Russia as “at an all-time & very dangerous low.” ""Our relationship with Russia is at an all-time & very dangerous low. You can thank Congress, the same people that can't even give us HCare!""
The new law, which also includes sanctions on Iran and North Korea, limits Mr. Trump’s ability to change restrictions on Russia and is a reflection of bipartisan concern that Mr. Trump would ease punishments for the Kremlin’s annexation of Crimea and meddling in the 2016 presidential election. In blaming Congress for the poor relations, Mr. Trump omits assigning responsibility to President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia for his role in Crimea, for violating a landmark arms control treaty with the deployment of a new cruise missile and for interference in elections in the United States and Europe.
Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona and a strong supporter of the sanctions bill, disagreed with the president.
Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether there was any coordination between the Kremlin and Mr. Trump’s campaign advisers to influence the 2016 election to benefit Mr. Trump. The president has called the investigations a “witch hunt.”
Russia had pre-emptively responded to the new sanctions by seizing two American diplomatic properties in Russia and ordering the United States to remove 755 members of its embassy staff stationed there. Mr. Trump has not publicly commented on the Kremlin’s response and did not invite the news media to cover the bill-signing event as he has for other laws. In a statement released on Wednesday, Mr. Trump called the law “significantly flawed,” and he said it included “a number of clearly unconstitutional provisions.”
Mr. Trump has said he wants to improve the United States’ relationship with Russia. He is not the first American president to bristle at Congress for interfering with the ability to set foreign policy.
On Wednesday, the Russian prime minister, Dmitri A. Medvedev, declared the “end to hope for the improvement of our relations” and mocked Mr. Trump as having been forced to sign the sanctions into law.
“The Trump administration has demonstrated total impotence, handing over executive functions to Congress in the most humiliating way possible,” Mr. Medvedev wrote on Facebook. He added that “the American establishment has totally outplayed Trump” with the goal “to remove him from power.”

The same day Mr. Trump signed the sanctions bill, Vice President Mike Pence was in the Balkan nation of Montenegro, reaffirming the United States’ commitment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Montenegro joined the alliance in June, a move that incensed Moscow. Mr. Pence’s tone on Russia was more assuring to NATO members than that of Mr. Trump, who once called NATO “obsolete” but has since praised the alliance.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/us/politics/trump-twitter-congress-russia.html,NYT
North Korea Tries to Make Hacking a Profit Center,07/27/2017," North Korea’s state-sponsored hackers are increasingly going after money rather than secrets, according to a report published on Thursday by a South Korean government-backed institute.

Cybersecurity experts have noticed a shift in the hacking attacks they suspected were mounted by North Korea. Formerly, most such attacks appeared intended to cause social disruption or purloin secret data, and the targets were generally the computer networks of government agencies or media companies in countries it considered hostile. The best-known example was a 2014 attack on computers at Sony Pictures Entertainment.

That kind of attack is still occurring, but in the last few years, North Korean hackers seem to have become more interested in stealing cash, the Financial Security Institute said in its report on Thursday.

The report said North Korean-linked hackers were behind the recent digital theft of $81 million from Bangladesh’s central bank. The North Koreans also tried to breach Polish banks, leaving traces that led anti-hacking experts to believe the hacking group also planned to steal money from more than 100 other organizations around the world.

North Korea is isolated, impoverished and desperately short of foreign currency to pay for imports. Even so, it has trained a large army of hackers, originally as an inexpensive means of espionage, sabotage and propaganda, but now also as a moneymaker.

Continue reading the main story
The Russian cybersecurity firm Kaspersky Lab has identified a hacking group called Bluenoroff that it says is to blame for attacks on foreign financial institutions, like those in Poland and Bangladesh. Bluenoroff is said to be an offshoot of Lazarus, the North Korea-linked hacking group implicated in earlier attacks.

The new report identified another Lazarus spinoff, which it named Andariel, and said that group was responsible for at least seven hacking attacks on banks, defense contractors and other businesses in South Korea over the last two years. (The names Lazarus and Andariel apparently refer to characters in a video game called Diablo.)

”Bluenoroff and Andariel share their common root,” the report said. “If Bluenoroff has attacked financial firms around the world, Andariel focuses on businesses and government agencies in South Korea using methods tailored for the country.”

The report said the Andariel group had increasingly shifted from destructive attacks on computer networks to crimes like stealing bank-card data and using it to draw cash from bank customers’ accounts or selling the data on the black market. The group also used malware to cheat at online poker and on other gambling websites.

“Andariel is believed to focus on earning hard currency,” the report said.

The Financial Security Institute, which is financed by the South Korean government, cautioned that the report was partly conjectural and did not represent an official view.

North Korea, a country that is cut off from much of the global economy and allows only a tiny portion of its population to have access to the internet, has been building up its cyberattack capabilities since the early 1990s, selecting teenagers and teaching them to be hackers, according to South Korean officials and defectors from the North. South Korean cybersecurity officials began detecting attacks attributed to North Korean hackers around 2009.

North Korea is now believed to have 1,700 state-sponsored hackers, aided by more than 5,000 supervisors, trainers and other support staff, South Korean officials estimate. The hackers typically do their work abroad, taking legitimate software programming or other jobs in China, Southeast Asia or Europe and waiting for instructions from Pyongyang to mount an assault, they said.

Going abroad is a rare privilege for North Koreans, and those who are allowed to work outside the country are required to send the government a quota of foreign currency every year, according to North Korean defectors.

North Korea has been accused of illicit moneymaking schemes to pay for its huge military, its nuclear weapons program and its leaders’ luxurious lifestyle, including gunrunning, drug trafficking and counterfeiting. As the United Nations has tightened sanctions and made those avenues more difficult, cyberattacks have loomed larger as a source of cash. Some hacking experts suspect North Korean involvement in the recent wave of global ransomware attacks.

The inevitability of North Korea's nuclear weapons,28-Jul-17,"TOKYO — North Korea’s trade deficit with China has risen to its highest level, as trade between the two countries continues to rise, suggesting there is little distress in the North Korean economy despite rounds of international sanctions on Pyongyang designed to punish it for its weapons program.             The latest official trade numbers from Beijing suggest that China, as President Trump tweeted last week, is not using its economic leverage over its defiant neighbor.                                                                                                                          “This growth shows that China is not willing to turn the screws on North Korea,” said Kent Boydston, an analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who closely follows the trade data.                                     The Trump administration has been calling on Beijing to use its economic leverage over its errant neighbor to make the Kim Jong Un regime stop firing off missiles and bellicose threats. But, after North Korea launched a missile last week technically capable of reaching the United States, Trump suggested he had given up on China.                                                                                             The latest release from China presents a muddied picture.                                         The Chinese customs department released figures that showed significant growth in overall bilateral trade in the first six months of the year.                      The value of imports from North Korea fell to $880 million in the six months that ended in June, down 13 percent from a year earlier, according to the figures. Notably, China’s coal imports from North Korea dropped precipitously, with only 2.7 million tons being shipped in the first half of 2017, down 75 percent from 2016.                                                                                                           But a 29 percent spike in Chinese exports to North Korea — North Korea bought $1.67 billion worth of Chinese products in the first six months of the year — helped push total trade between the two countries up 10 percent between January and June, compared with the same period last year.                   But the customs office did not release a full breakdown of the trade data, and previous releases have sent confusing signals.
“The numbers are not making sense, and my instinct is to think that the Chinese are underplaying what they’re doing,” said Boydston, who recommends taking the figures with a “large dose” of salt.                                      But the overall picture suggests that North Korea is buying increasing amounts of products from China.
By Boydston’s calculations, the trade deficit widened to a cumulative $600 million between January and May, the highest on record. “North Korea is somehow able to finance buying all these Chinese products,” he said.
This is puzzling to economists because North Korea has no access to the international financial system, which other countries tap to fund their trade deficits. Furthermore, there have been no major fluctuations in the North Korean won, suggesting stability in the economy.                                                     Beijing was quick to pour cold water on the suggestion that the overall rise in trade suggested it was not complying with U.N. Security Council resolutions designed to punish Pyongyang for its nuclear tests and missile launches.
The growth in bilateral trade “should not be used as basis for questioning China’s solemn attitude towards the implementation of the Security Council’s resolutions,” Huang Songping, a spokesman for Chinese Customs, told reporters in Beijing.                                                                                                      Monthly figures were more representative of the trend, he said, and China’s imports from North Korea had been “falling sharply for four consecutive months since March,” including by 36 percent in March and 42 percent in April.
“The trade growth between China and North Korea in the first half of the year was mainly driven by exports,” Huang said, adding that the exports were mainly labor-intensive products such as textiles, which are not banned under U.N. resolutions.                                                                                                            China has been pledging to curtail trade with North Korea as part of international actions against the Kim regime, but government officials and analysts alike are skeptical about how far China will go.
China said in February it would suspend coal imports from North Korea, potentially cutting off a major financial lifeline for Pyongyang, although analysts caution that Chinese figures should be viewed with some skepticism as they are sometimes manipulated for political purposes.                                      About 90 percent of North Korea’s exports go to China, and coal has been the single biggest export item. But there has been skepticism about China’s ban, with coal ships and train cars being seen going back and forth between the two countries.
Furthermore, as coal exports have reportedly fallen, shipments of iron ore to China have spiked. Previous releases of Chinese customs data showed that China bought the same amount of iron ore in the first five months of this year as it did in all of last year.                                                                                         Asked about the surge in China’s imports of North Korean iron ore and in China’s ethanol exports to North Korea in recent months, Huang said that trade with North Korea for civilian use was allowed despite the sanctions.
“We have carried out the U.N. resolution strictly,” Huang said. “If this is for civilian use and not banned, after we have verified that they are for civilian use, we can still trade.” Huang said the price fluctuation of commodities could also potentially boost the trade figure as measured by value.                                  As the United States has searched for ways to punish North Korea for its repeated defiance of international bans on its nuclear weapons testing and ballistic missile launches, it has repeatedly turned to China. Trump has urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to use China’s economic dominance to sway North Korea on nuclear testing. But after suggesting that Beijing was not acting to punish Pyongyang, Trump last week suggested he had given up on Xi.
“Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter,” Trump tweeted the day after North Korea launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile. “So much for China working with us — but we had to give it a try!” 
Xi has made no secret of his disdain for Kim and is clearly frustrated at North Korea’s weapons testing and actions such as the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the leader’s half brother who had been protected by China.                          But many North Korea analysts suggest China will not take any action that could seriously undermine the regime because Beijing’s top priority is stability. It does not want a flood of millions of hungry refugees coming over its northeast border if the Pyongyang regime collapses, and it certainly does not want the 28,000 U.S. troops currently stationed in South Korea to be able to move all the way up the peninsula to the border with China.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/07/28/the-inevitability-of-north-koreas-nuclear-weapons/?utm_term=.f905d0e0175a,wapo
There are 3 big reasons South Korea's new preident wants talk with North Kores,17-Jul-17,"Faced with a North Korea that seems both increasingly unpredictable and increasingly militarily capable, South Korea's new government has made a formal proposal: It's time for new talks.
Suh Choo-suk, South Korea's vice defense minister, announced the proposal Monday, suggesting that the two neighboring nations could meet in the border village of Panmunjom to discuss military and humanitarian issues. If the North agrees (it so far has issued no response), it would be the first talk between the two governments since 2015.
The news comes in the wake of a number of key developments in North Korea's nuclear weapons program — including, most shockingly, the July 4 launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit Alaska. But talks have long been touted as an option for South Korea's liberal new president, Moon Jae-in, when it comes to dealing with the North.                                            “I will meet Kim Jong Un when preconditions of resolving the nuclear issue are assured,” Moon told The Washington Post's Anna Fifield and Yoonjung Seo in May, days before he entered office.                                                                            Will a policy of dialogue work? Right now, that's impossible to say, but Moon's push for it comes down to three stark reasons.                                             1. Any military conflict with North Korea would be disastrous for the South
Internationally, a lot of attention is paid to North Korea's nuclear weapons and its advancing missile technology. The fear is that once North Korea has the ability to launch a nuclear weapon that could target the mainland United States, it would be a major deterrent against any future military action.                But for Seoul, the deterrent is already there. South Korea's capital city sits just 30 miles from the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The city, which has a metropolitan area of around 25 million, is within easy reach of North Korea's artillery guns. If North Korea decided to use these weapons, they could cause huge damage in a short amount of time.
But for Seoul, the deterrent is already there. South Korea's capital city sits just 30 miles from the Korean Demilitarized Zone (DMZ). The city, which has a metropolitan area of around 25 million, is within easy reach of North Korea's artillery guns. If North Korea decided to use these weapons, they could cause huge damage in a short amount of time.
One study from 2012 estimated that 64,000 people could be killed by this artillery in the first day. Even if South Korea and its American allies could destroy these weapons quickly, it would likely not be quick enough to stop massive bloodshed — including considerable losses among U.S. troops stationed in South Korea.
Worse still, North Korea now has nuclear weapons that it can likely mount on missiles that could likely reach South Korea, raising the possibility of a conflict of incredible destruction. Many of these nuclear weapons are hidden away, meaning a preemptive strike would be unlikely to disable them.                            2. Sanctions don't appear to be changing North Korea's behavior
The other big option for dealing with North Korea is to apply economic pressure, rather than military pressure, in the hope of convincing North Korea to halt its nuclear weapons program. There is evidence that in some cases such a policy can work: Sanctions certainly played at least some role in bringing Iran to the table to negotiate its own treaty on nuclear weapons.
But here, too, there's a problem. North Korea is already under sanctions and it has been for years. And during that time, it appears to have become more determined to pursue its weapons system. So far, at least, sanctions have not worked on North Korea.
Experts say that North Korea has become adept at evading these economic restrictions placed upon it, often using illicit networks to organize its trade. “The sanctions were perfunctory,” Ri Jong Ho, a former North Korean official who defected in 2014, recently told The Post.                                                           Sanctions do still seem to be the favored option for the United States. There are signs that the Trump administration is hoping to increase sanctions effectiveness by getting more creative — targeting Chinese firms and individuals involved in trade with North Korea, or smaller countries like Sudan that still have an economic relationship with Pyongyang. However, it's still hard to imagine China or Russia getting fully on board with more economic pressure. Both countries share borders with North Korea and have little desire for it to collapse. Even being charitable, Beijing and Moscow's commitment to sanctions has been halfhearted.
Moon still supports sanctions, suggesting that new ones were needed when he appeared in Berlin with German leader Angela Merkel shortly after the July 4 ICBM test. But he is also seeking to improve Seoul's relationship with Beijing, currently under huge strain due to THAAD, a U.S. missile system recently installed in South Korea and viewed as a threat by China.                        3. Previous talks have produced some results
Moon is far from the first South Korean leader to seek dialogue with North Korea. Two of his liberal predecessors, Kim Dae-jung and Roh Moo-hyun, implemented what was known as a “Sunshine Policy” between 1998 and 2008. The policy was designed to soften Seoul's stance toward Pyongyang, encouraging political interaction and economic agreements.                                  Moon knows the policy well — he was Roh's campaign manager during his election bid and a close aide during his time in office. After a decade of attempts at reconciliation, many viewed the Sunshine Policy as a failure. Critics suggested that North Korea had used it for financial gain without making real concessions in important areas such as its nuclear program or human rights. South Korea returned to conservative rule in 2008. Under the leadership of Lee Myung-bak and later Park Geun-hye, most of the key elements of the policy — such as the jointly run Kaesong Industrial Region — have been shut down or scaled back.
But now, after another decade of a new, harsher policy failed to curb Pyongyang's antagonism, some argue it is time to revisit the merits of a Sunshine Policy. There is also a groundswell of support behind Moon after a huge scandal led to Park's impeachment — one poll showed Moon with the highest approval rating ever for a South Korean president this early in their first term — and there is a desire for stability after so much domestic political upheaval.
Moon may be able to win some short-term agreements from North Korea, which also made a call for talks in 2016. Both sides could scale back the tension along the DMZ or reintroduce a military hotline cut off by North Korea last year. The South Korean Red Cross Society has also proposed an attempt to set up reunions for families split between the North and South — an emotional issue in both countries. Similar reunions have not taken place since 2015.
A recent poll found that nearly 76.9 percent of South Koreans favored a return to inter-Korean dialogue. It's not clear how they would feel if Seoul offered too many concessions or North Korea failed to live up to its side of the bargain or act belligerently. But right now, many liberal South Koreans seem to feel that talks are the best option of a bad bunch.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/07/17/there-are-3-big-reasons-south-koreas-new-president-wants-talks-with-north-korea/?utm_term=.0c7ff24c0690,wapo
North Korean travel ban marks return to Cold War-era Restrictions on U.S. citizens abroad,21-Jul-17,"U.S. citizens have long been able to visit North Korea as tourists, but that will soon change. On Friday, the Trump administration announced that it was planning to bar U.S. tourists from traveling to North Korea next month.
The move coincides with increasing tension between the Trump administration and Pyongyang about North Korea's nuclear weapons program. It also comes after Otto Warmbier, an American student, was detained while on a trip to North Korea and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor.
Warmbier later died, just six days after being released, in a comatose state, and flown to Ohio.
The decision to ban travel by U.S. citizens to a foreign country marks an unusual policy shift for the State Department, harking back to restrictions on travel not widely used since the Cold War era.                                                             Though the State Department routinely issues alerts and warnings about travel to certain countries (a warning is currently in place for North Korea), these serve only as recommendations and do not bar travel. And while U.S. nationals may in some cases find themselves barred from certain countries, that is generally the decision of a foreign government rather than the State Department.                                                                                                                    “The safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas is one of our highest priorities,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said late Friday morning as the ban was announced. “Due to mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea’s system of law enforcement, [Secretary of State Rex Tillerson] has authorized a Geographical Travel Restriction on all U.S. citizen nationals’ use of a passport to travel in, through, or to North Korea.”
Peter Spiro, the Charles Weiner chair in international law at Temple University, said such a policy would be a revival of “area restrictions” that were common during the mid-20th century.
“At various points, Americans were barred from traveling to various communist countries during the Cold War,” Spiro said in an email, noting that the practice went back as far as the 1920s.
These restrictions were noted explicitly on the passports themselves. A passport issued in 1954 to Jacqueline Kennedy, later the first lady, shows a page noting that the passport was not to be used for travel to “Albania, Bulgaria, China, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, Romania or the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics,” for example.
“The safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas is one of our highest priorities,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said late Friday morning as the ban was announced. “Due to mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention under North Korea’s system of law enforcement, [Secretary of State Rex Tillerson] has authorized a Geographical Travel Restriction on all U.S. citizen nationals’ use of a passport to travel in, through, or to North Korea.”
The logic behind these bans was varied. Sometimes they were used to restrict travel to a country after U.S. citizens were captured or detained there, such as after the Iran hostage crisis between 1979 and 1981 or the kidnappings of Americans in Lebanon during the late 1980s.
Such restrictions were last implemented against countries in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and none of those bans remain in place. The U.S. government appears to have moved away from State Department-ordered travel bans and instead used the Treasury Department to restrict tourism-related transactions in foreign countries (most notably Cuba).
Spiro argued that a return to the use of travel bans would have legal standing, however. “The Supreme Court found the secretary of state to have the power to impose these restrictions in its 1965 decision in Zemel v. Rusk,” Spiro wrote. “In that case, the court rejected a First Amendment challenge to an area restriction (a ban on travel to Cuba) and also rejected the assertion of a constitutional right to international travel.”                                                               Though Spiro said he expected any ban on U.S. travel to North Korea to face legal challenges, he said he thought the legal precedent would allow the ban to stick.
What was less clear, however, was how the law would work practically. Even when area restrictions were more widely used, legal experts argued that they were very difficult to enforce. State Department area restrictions on Iran were undermined when Ramsey Clark, a former attorney general, traveled to Tehran in 1980 in a bid to help defuse the ongoing hostage crisis. The Justice Department ultimately decided not to prosecute Clark, in part because of legal uncertainty about the outcome.
There are no direct connections between the United States and North Korea, with most travelers instead going through China to reach the country. Matthew Bradley, regional security director for the Americas at the travel safety firm International SOS and Control Risks, said he imagined that tourists who went to China or other neighboring countries would have their passports flagged before they reached U.S. immigration officers.
“They'll be looking for indications that you were in the country you said you were in,” Bradley said in a phone call, adding that he would expect “pretty strict enforcement for the first six months to a year” after the new rules took effect. Even considering the threat of  prosecution, he said it was likely that U.S. citizens would still try to visit North Korea. “It's very difficult to remove the incentive,” Bradley said. “There will still be people who risk it.”                         Instead, Bradley said, it would probably be the companies that organize trips to North Korea for foreigners that respond. Two of these companies, Koryo Tours and Young Pioneer Tours, have issued statements acknowledging the new rules. (Young Pioneer Tours had already announced that it would no longer take Americans to North Korea after Warmbier's death.)
Bradley added that, ultimately, the biggest responsibility lies with tourists — and his company has long advised against U.S. citizens traveling to North Korea.
“The risk is that the government will seize you. And the reasons that they might seize you are arbitrary,” he said. “And when the risk cannot be mitigated through conventional means, it has to be avoided.”

He ran North Kore's secret moneymaking operation. Now he lives in Virginia,13-Jul-17,"Efforts to sanction North Korea into submission won’t work because there are too many ways around them, Ri Jong Ho says.  
He should know.
For about three decades, Ri was a top moneymaker for the Kim regime, sending millions of dollars a year back to Pyongyang even as round after round of sanctions was imposed to try to punish North Korea for its nuclear defiance. 
“We were never in pain or hurting in our trade business because of the sanctions. Instead, we conducted our first nuclear test in 2006,” Ri said in an interview near Tysons Corner.  
The 59-year-old, whose job had been to raise money for the North Korean regime, and his family live in Northern Virginia, having defected to South Korea at the end of 2014 and moved to the United States last year. 
“I used to be sanctioned, as a North Korean who led trade at the front line, but I never felt any pain from the sanctions. The sanctions were perfunctory,” Ri said. 
He described being able to send millions of U.S. dollars to North Korea simply by handing a bag of cash to the captain of a ship leaving from the Chinese port city of Dalian, where he was based, to the North Korean port of Nampo, or by giving it to someone to take on the train across the border.                              In first the nine months of 2014 — he defected in October that year — Ri said he sent about $10 million to Pyongyang this way. 
[ Trump warns of ‘severe’ consequences for North Korea as Russia, China balk at tough U.S. talk ]
For more than two decades, the United States has been trying to convince North Korea to abandon its nuclear weapons program, alternating between inducements and punishments.
In both cases,  American policy has  relied on China, North Korea’s erstwhile patron, using its economic power over its cash-strapped neighbor. But Beijing’s implementation of sanctions, even those it backed through the United Nations, has been patchy at best. China’s overwhelming priority is ensuring stability in North Korea.
President Trump has repeatedly called on China to support his policy of putting “maximum pressure” on Pyongyang to stop its nuclear and missile programs. 
Efforts have not changed North Korea’s behavior. This is partly because multilateral sanctions imposed through the United Nations must be watered down to avoid being vetoed by China or Russia, traditional backers of North Korea, and partly because other countries don’t implement the  tougher but unilateral U.S. sanctions. 
“Unless China, Russia and the United States cooperate fully to sanction North Korea, it will be impossible to hurt them,” Ri said. 
China’s interest in North Korea is well known, but Russia’s role in supporting the former Soviet client state is often overlooked. Amid calls for China to limit oil exports to North Korea, Russia has dramatically increased the amount of oil it has sent — some reports suggest exports have quadrupled — to North Korea this year.  
North Korea’s financial networks, moreover, are  intentionally murky. The U.S. Treasury has sanctioned more and more North Koreans and North Korean companies by name to try to cut them off from the American financial system, but few, if any, have any exposure to the United States.
For this reason, Ri’s insights are widely sought after in Washington, where successive administrations have been trying to find North Korea’s pressure points. 
[ The messy data behind China’s growing trade with North Korea ]
Ri worked for three decades in Office 39, the Workers’ Party operation responsible for raising money for the North Korean leader. The office has long been associated with both legal trade and illicit activity, including counterfeiting dollars and drug smuggling.                                                                 Ri said he worked as president of a shipping company and was chairman of Korea Kumgang Group, a company that formed a venture with Sam Pa, a Chinese businessman, to start a taxi company in Pyongyang. Ri suppled a photo of him and Pa aboard a jet to Pyongyang. 
He was awarded the title “hero of labor” in 2002 for his efforts, and said he lived the good life in Pyongyang, with a color TV and a car. “I was very loyal to Kim Jong Il, so I was rewarded by him,” he said. “I was rich.”
His last position was running the Dalian branch of Daeheung, a trading company involved in shipping, coal and seafood exports, and oil imports. The company was given targets to meet in terms of profits, he said, declining to go into details. 
But in 2014, Ri grew increasingly disillusioned after Kim Jong Un suddenly denounced his uncle, Jang Song Thaek, as a “traitor for all ages” and had him executed at the end of 2013.  
Jang had been leading economic cooperation efforts with China, and dozens of people who worked for him were also purged at the time, Ri said. He worried that his family would be next. They escaped to South Korea before moving to the United States, where his two children, now in their 20s, plan to go to college.                                                                                                                Experts said Ri’s arrival in the United States could be a boon for American efforts to crack down on North Korea.
“It’s always useful when a defector, especially one that knows the internal operations of Office 39 — and my assumption is that he knows the external operations too — can help us,” said Anthony Ruggiero, who worked on sanctions at Treasury and is now with the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies.
The United States has been trying to understand how North Korea uses banks in China in particular to finance its activities. “I hope that the Treasury and some other organizations with ‘agency’ at the end of their name are talking to him,” Ruggiero said.
[ The secret to Kim’s success? Some experts see Russian echoes in North Korea’s missile advances ]
Ri said North Korea has repeatedly found ways to circumvent whatever sanctions are imposed on it.
“North Korea is a 100 percent state enterprise, so these companies just change their names the day after they’re sanctioned,” he said. “That way the company continues, but with a different name than the one on the sanctions list.”
Ri’s Chinese counterparts weren’t bothered, either, he said.
“My partners in China also want to make a profit, so they don't care much about sanctions,” he said. “When the Chinese government orders them to stop, they stop for a few days and then start up again.” 
Growing impatient with Beijing, Washington is increasingly targeting Chinese companies that help North Korea with what are called “secondary sanctions.” At the end of last month, the Trump administration blacklisted the Bank of Dandong, located on the border between the two countries, for its dealings with North Korea. 
But without knowing how to really hurt North Korea and teaming up to do it, it will be “impossible” to change Pyongyang’s calculus on the nuclear program, Ri said.
For that reason, the former money man advocates an approach that combines Trump’s “maximum pressure” with another idea that the president has at least flirted with: talks.
“I think there should be top-level talks between the U.S. and North Korea, so that they can both work together to solve the problem,” Ri said.
After last week’s intercontinental ballistic missile test and last month’s death of Otto Warmbier, the Ohio college student who returned from 17 months’ detention in North Korea in a coma, talks seem a long way off.                                But Trump, a businessman who prides himself on being a master negotiator, has said he would be “honored” to meet Kim, whom he called a “smart cookie.” 
At unofficial talks in Oslo in May, a North Korean delegation signaled to American representatives Kim’s interest in talking, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions.
Previous diplomatic efforts to convince North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons have failed, and there is a great deal of skepticism in Washington about negotiations. 
But that shouldn’t stop the current administration from trying, Ri said: “Like they say in politics, yesterday's enemy can be today’s friend.”",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/he-ran-north-koreas-secret-money-making-operation-now-he-lives-in-virginia/2017/07/12/4cb9a590-6584-11e7-94ab-5b1f0ff459df_story.html?utm_term=.22f38963d231,wapo
Where are the bodies buried in North Korea? Investigaors try to prepare for future trials.,18-Jul-17,"SEOUL — Efforts to hold the Kim regime accountable for decades of brutality against the North Korean people have so far amounted to little, but that isn’t stopping human rights activists from trying to document the abuses.
The latest effort is an ambitious project by the Seoul-based Transitional Justice Working Group that aims to map sites of mass killings and mass burials in North Korea so that — one day — evidence can be collected and the regime can be held responsible.
“Victim testimony was often given a limited place in previous hearings, like those on the former Yugoslavia and on the Holocaust,” said Sarah Son, one of the authors of the mapping report, which will be published Wednesday. “But location-based data provides a bigger picture on patterns of abuse within a country.”
The research was backed by the National Endowment for Democracy, which seeks to bolster civil society and democratic institutions around the world and is financed by the U.S. Congress.
The working group interviewed 375 defectors from North Korea over the past two years. They were shown maps of their home towns and asked to identify places where abuses occurred. The researchers say they have been able to pinpoint 47 sites where bodies were buried or dumped, and hundreds more that might yield documentary evidence in the future.
There is no sign that Kim Jong Un, the third-generation leader of North Korea, or his regime is going to change or collapse anytime soon, but Son said it is not too early to plan.
“People who have done this kind of work in Croatia or Southeast Asia keep telling us we can’t be too prepared for what might happen in the future,” she said.
The report says that the mapping project could contribute to “the collective effort to support the push for accountability, as well as .?.?. future efforts to institute a process of transitional justice following a change in the political conditions in North Korea.”
North Korea’s regime is known to be one of the most brutal in the world, using repression and fear to keep its 25 million citizens under control. It has always denied human rights investigators access to the country.
A landmark report by a United Nations commission of inquiry in 2014 detailed a litany of abuses committed in North Korea over the decades, including torture, hard labor in political prison camps, forced abortions and infanticide, and brainwashing. This is in addition to the hunger and inability to speak their minds that ordinary people endure on a daily basis.                                               The commission recommended referring Kim to the International Criminal Court to face charges of crimes against humanity, a recommendation that elicited an unprecedented response from Pyongyang. North Korean diplomats at the United Nations began engaging critics for the first time, and the regime released its own report on American “human rights abuses.”
But the efforts did not result in Kim being referred to the ICC because the recommendations could not get through the Security Council, where China and Russia, North Korea’s historic patrons, wield vetoes.
“The commission of inquiry report was not the end, it was just the start,” said Oh Se-hyek, a North Korean defector and another of the report’s authors. “We must continue that work.”
The group asked North Korean defectors to point out places in their home towns where they had directly seen or heard executions or mass burials taking place, or where they had heard from a witness of such an event happening.
By cross-referencing the places the defectors identified, the group came up with 47 sites where forensic evidence might be collected in the future, and sites such as police stations or security offices where documents might be found.                                                                                                                           Most of the sites were in North Hamgyong, a province that shares a long border with China. This province is the source of most defectors from North Korea because of the ease in crossing into China from there and because the residents — whose loyalty Pyongyang considers suspect — are most neglected by the regime.
Some interviewed defectors reported seeing or hearing about mass executions by hanging or shooting. Others described burial sites on or near the grounds of prison camps, or on mountainsides near police and state security buildings. Former prisoners described seeing or hearing of places were bodies were incinerated.
One former political prisoner reported having seen a list of more than 100 inmates who had been executed in secret over the course of a year, in 1999. The list was held by the state security agency and the local police office operating within the camp, the former prisoner said.
North Korea, like other authoritarian regimes, keeps systematic records, so securing these documents could be important for future trials, just as Stasi documents were important after the collapse of East Germany, the report’s authors wrote. “We aim to record the locations of these sites for future safeguarding of documents.”                                                                                      The group did not disclose the locations of the burial sites, saying it feared that the North Korean regime would seek to destroy any evidence if it knew certain sites had been identified.
Sandra Fahy, an expert on North Korean human rights who teaches at Sophia University in Tokyo, said that the report was an “important and critical step in a long process of keeping track of North Korea’s atrocities.”
“Its impact could be two-fold,” she said. “First, it will further the process of accountability and recordkeeping — with a move toward justice for victims and family members — in the future.”
But, Fahy said, it could also inspire North Korean officials to take more precautions in killing and disposing of victims. “North Korea does keep track and respond domestically to the pressures of the international community, but not always in ways we might like,” Fahy said.",https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/where-are-the-bodies-buried-in-north-korea-investigators-try-to-prepare-for-future-trials/2017/07/18/48349113-7976-463a-a569-466ad84657c0_story.html?utm_term=.ef03f783b87a,wapo
"Chinese figures show trade is up with North Korea, but questions abound",13-Jul-17,"TOKYO — North Korea’s trade deficit with China has risen to its highest level, as trade between the two countries continues to rise, suggesting there is little distress in the North Korean economy despite rounds of international sanctions on Pyongyang designed to punish it for its weapons program.
The latest official trade numbers from Beijing suggest that China, as President Trump tweeted last week, is not using its economic leverage over its defiant neighbor.
“This growth shows that China is not willing to turn the screws on North Korea,” said Kent Boydston, an analyst at the Peterson Institute for International Economics who closely follows the trade data.
The Trump administration has been calling on Beijing to use its economic leverage over its errant neighbor to make the Kim Jong Un regime stop firing off missiles and bellicose threats. But, after North Korea launched a missile last week technically capable of reaching the United States, Trump suggested he had given up on China. 
The latest release from China presents a muddied picture.                                           The Chinese customs department released figures that showed significant growth in overall bilateral trade in the first six months of the year.                           The value of imports from North Korea fell to $880 million in the six months that ended in June, down 13 percent from a year earlier, according to the figures. Notably, China’s coal imports from North Korea dropped precipitously, with only 2.7 million tons being shipped in the first half of 2017, down 75 percent from 2016. 
But a 29 percent spike in Chinese exports to North Korea — North Korea bought $1.67 billion worth of Chinese products in the first six months of the year — helped push total trade between the two countries up 10 percent between January and June, compared with the same period last year.
[He ran North Korea’s secret moneymaking operation. Now he lives in Virginia.]
But the customs office did not release a full breakdown of the trade data, and previous releases have sent confusing signals.
“The numbers are not making sense, and my instinct is to think that the Chinese are underplaying what they’re doing,” said Boydston, who recommends taking the figures with a “large dose” of salt.                                      But the overall picture suggests that North Korea is buying increasing amounts of products from China.
By Boydston’s calculations, the trade deficit widened to a cumulative $600 million between January and May, the highest on record. “North Korea is somehow able to finance buying all these Chinese products,” he said.
This is puzzling to economists because North Korea has no access to the international financial system, which other countries tap to fund their trade deficits. Furthermore, there have been no major fluctuations in the North Korean won, suggesting stability in the economy.
Beijing was quick to pour cold water on the suggestion that the overall rise in trade suggested it was not complying with U.N. Security Council resolutions designed to punish Pyongyang for its nuclear tests and missile launches.
The growth in bilateral trade “should not be used as basis for questioning China’s solemn attitude towards the implementation of the Security Council’s resolutions,” Huang Songping, a spokesman for Chinese Customs, told reporters in Beijing.                                                                                                    Monthly figures were more representative of the trend, he said, and China’s imports from North Korea had been “falling sharply for four consecutive months since March,” including by 36 percent in March and 42 percent in April.
“The trade growth between China and North Korea in the first half of the year was mainly driven by exports,” Huang said, adding that the exports were mainly labor-intensive products such as textiles, which are not banned under U.N. resolutions. 
[ The messy data behind China’s growing trade with North Korea ]
China has been pledging to curtail trade with North Korea as part of international actions against the Kim regime, but government officials and analysts alike are skeptical about how far China will go.
China said in February it would suspend coal imports from North Korea, potentially cutting off a major financial lifeline for Pyongyang, although analysts caution that Chinese figures should be viewed with some skepticism as they are sometimes manipulated for political purposes.                                     About 90 percent of North Korea’s exports go to China, and coal has been the single biggest export item. But there has been skepticism about China’s ban, with coal ships and train cars being seen going back and forth between the two countries.
Furthermore, as coal exports have reportedly fallen, shipments of iron ore to China have spiked. Previous releases of Chinese customs data showed that China bought the same amount of iron ore in the first five months of this year as it did in all of last year. 
Asked about the surge in China’s imports of North Korean iron ore and in China’s ethanol exports to North Korea in recent months, Huang said that trade with North Korea for civilian use was allowed despite the sanctions.
“We have carried out the U.N. resolution strictly,” Huang said. “If this is for civilian use and not banned, after we have verified that they are for civilian use, we can still trade.” Huang said the price fluctuation of commodities could also potentially boost the trade figure as measured by value.
[ As concern about North Korea deepens, the U.S. and China are at odds ]
As the United States has searched for ways to punish North Korea for its repeated defiance of international bans on its nuclear weapons testing and ballistic missile launches, it has repeatedly turned to China. Trump has urged Chinese President Xi Jinping to use China’s economic dominance to sway North Korea on nuclear testing. But after suggesting that Beijing was not acting to punish Pyongyang, Trump last week suggested he had given up on Xi.
“Trade between China and North Korea grew almost 40% in the first quarter,” Trump tweeted the day after North Korea launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile. “So much for China working with us — but we had to give it a try!” 
Xi has made no secret of his disdain for Kim and is clearly frustrated at North Korea’s weapons testing and actions such as the assassination of Kim Jong Nam, the leader’s half brother who had been protected by China. 
But many North Korea analysts suggest China will not take any action that could seriously undermine the regime because Beijing’s top priority is stability. It does not want a flood of millions of hungry refugees coming over its northeast border if the Pyongyang regime collapses, and it certainly does not want the 28,000 U.S. troops currently stationed in South Korea to be able to move all the way up the peninsula to the border with China.

"Most Americans worry about full-scale war with North Korea, but lack confidence in Trump to handle issue",18-Jul-17,"Nearly three-quarters of Americans are concerned the United States could get involved in a full-scale war with North Korea, even as a majority lacks trust in President Trump to handle the situation, according to a new Washington Post-ABC News poll.
A new high of 66 percent say North Korea poses a ""serious threat"" to the United States, up from 54 percent in a 2005 Post-ABC poll and 55 percent in 2003, with concern spanning partisan and ideological lines.

The poll was conducted shortly after North Korea launched its farthest-reaching missile test to date in July with a range experts say could reach Alaska. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the missile test was a new escalation of the threat posed to the United States and the world, and that Washington would bring North Korea's action before the U.N. Security Council.
The Post-ABC poll finds lagging confidence in Trump to handle the situation, with 36 percent saying they trust Trump at least ""a good amount"" to deal with the issue, while 63 percent have ""just some"" or less confidence. Four in 10 say they do not trust Trump ""at all"" on the issue, nearly twice the number who express ""a great deal"" of confidence. 
As with approval of Trump in general, there is a large partisan divide in the public's faith in Trump on this issue. An 81 percent majority of Republicans trust Trump at least a good amount to handle North Korea, while only 11 percent of Democrats say the same. Independents are closer to Democrats, with 31 percent trusting Trump a good amount or more while 66 percent trust him just some or not at all.
Ideological differences are also sharp but unbalanced. While 86 percent of liberals trust Trump just some or not at all to deal with North Korea, a smaller 66 percent majority of conservatives express faith in his leadership.                         There are also political divisions in concerns about a full-scale war breaking out with North Korea. Overall, 74 percent of Americans say they are very or somewhat concerned about this prospect, including 39 percent who are ""very concerned"" while 35 percent are ""somewhat concerned.""

"North Korea's surprising, lucrative relationship with Africa",10-Jul-17,"WINDHOEK, Namibia — Near the southern tip of Africa, 8,000 miles from Pyongyang, this capital city is an unlikely testament to North Korean industry.
There’s the futuristic national history museum, the sleek presidential palace, the sprawling defense headquarters and the shadowy munitions factory. They were built — or are still being constructed — by North Korea, for a profit.
For years, North Korea has used African nations like this one as financial lifelines, building infrastructure and selling weapons and other military equipment as sanctions mounted against its authoritarian regime. Although China is by far North Korea’s largest trading partner, the smaller African revenue streams have helped support the impoverished Hermit Kingdom, even as its leaders develop an ambitious nuclear weapons program in defiance of the international community.
Those ambitions led last week to the launch of the country’s first intercontinental ballistic missile. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson subsequently warned that any nation with military or economic ties to North Korea “is aiding and abetting a dangerous regime,” and the Trump administration threatened a cutoff in trade with countries that were doing business with the pariah nation.                                                                                                                  But Namibian officials describe a different North Korea — a longtime ally, a partner in development and an affordable contractor. Since the 1960s, when North Korea began providing support for African nations during their independence struggles with European colonial powers, the regime has fostered political ties on the continent that have turned into commercial relationships.                                                                                                                “We’ve relied on them for help to develop our infrastructure, and their work has been unparalleled,” said Frans Kapofi, Namibia’s minister of presidential affairs.                                                                                                                        Across Africa, such relationships have been common.
A United Nations investigation this year described North Korean military radio equipment headed to Eritrea, automatic weapons arriving in Congo and military trainers landing in Angola and Uganda.
“The Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is flouting sanctions through trade in prohibited goods, with evasion techniques that are increasing in scale, scope and sophistication,” the report said. It went on to describe how “the country also uses its construction companies that are active in Africa to build arms-related, military and security facilities.”                                                  North Korea’s commercial relationships are only one sign of the surprisingly close ties many African leaders have with the secretive, highly repressive Asian country.
Yoweri Museveni, Uganda’s longtime president, said he learned basic Korean from Kim Il Sung, the former leader of North Korea and grandfather of current leader Kim Jong Un, during various visits to that country. Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe sent two rhinos to Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, as a show of solidarity in the 1980s (both died shortly after arriving). In Maputo, Mozambique’s capital, a street named Avenida Kim Il Sung runs through the heart of downtown. In Namibia’s national museum, a black-and-white picture of a North Korean soldier leading a group of local soldiers hangs in the foyer.
“Our world outlook was determined by who was on our side during the most crucial time of our struggle, and North Korea was there for us,” said Tuliameni Kalomoh, a senior adviser in the Namibian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the country’s former ambassador to Washington.                                                           In recent years, African countries have struggled to maintain their ties to North Korea without alienating the United States, the largest aid donor on the continent, or publicly violating U.N. sanctions aimed at curbing the country’s nuclear-weapons program. In measures going back a decade, the United Nations has barred countries from contracting with North Korea for military training or services or arms manufacturing.                                                              “Pyongyang’s ties to Africa allow it to show it still has friends abroad and benefit from their political support. They also represent a source of revenue, new entry points into the international financial system, and a haven in which to base North Korean representatives and front companies,” said Andrea Berger, a North Korea expert at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey.
The Namibian government has spent about $100 million on North Korean projects since 2002, according to officials here — a sum that goes a long way in an Asian nation where per capita income is about $1,000 per year. But in comparison, China imports about $3 billion in North Korean goods per year.
Last year, the United Nations said that Namibia had violated U.N. sanctions by maintaining its commercial ties to North Korea.
Among other activities, Namibia had contracted with a North Korean company called Mansudae Overseas Projects to construct a munitions factory as well as a new military academy. A company with links to Mansudae, called the Korea Mining Development Trading Corporation (known as KOMID) also worked on the munitions factory, according to the U.N. report. The Treasury Department last year called KOMID North Korea’s “primary arms dealer” and sanctioned two North Korean officials based in Windhoek. The department also sanctioned Mansudae, calling it one of a number of companies that sent workers abroad in part to earn money for the government or ruling party.
After being accused of violating sanctions, Namibian officials pledged to cut commercial ties with North Korea, which is formally known as the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, or DPRK. The Namibian government said in a statement in 2016 that it “remains committed to the implementation of all U.N. sanctions resolutions,” but added that “the warm diplomatic relations with the DPRK will be maintained.”
Over a year later, it appears that North Korean guest workers are still laboring on Namibia’s new Ministry of Defense, a large concrete building just outside of Windhoek’s city center, according to several residents who live nearby.
“We see them every day or two,” said one resident who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he didn’t want to be seen as criticizing the government. “They never left.”
In interviews, government officials said they were hoping to complete the current projects before expelling the workers — even though allowing the North Korean contractors to linger would probably be a violation of U.N. sanctions if they are still affiliated with KOMID.
“We are definitely towards the end of phasing them out,” said Kapofi, who added that he could not confirm the presence of the guest workers at the defense ministry.
Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, recently warned that the United States might cut off trade with countries that were violating U.N. sanctions by doing business with North Korea.
Namibia did $469 million of trade with the United States in 2013, according to the most recent figures released by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The U.S. government also contributes to Namibian health-care initiatives, particularly related to HIV/AIDS.
“As a part of our maximum pressure campaign, we are committed to ensuring that DPRK’s arms-related exports, assistance, training, and support activities are terminated, including in Africa,” said State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert, in response to a question about Namibia’s ties with North Korea.
Other African countries were also supposed to end their economic and military relationships with North Korea after the U.N. sanctions were imposed. But it remains unclear whether some have done so.
U.N. member states are obliged to issue reports describing their efforts to enforce sanctions. But the U.N. panel of experts report in 2016 noted “an extremely high number of non-reporting and late-reporting States” and the “poor quality and lack of detail of the reports received.”
Some African nations have appeared to distance themselves from North Korea. After photos appeared showing North Korean military trainers wearing Ugandan military uniforms last year, Uganda’s foreign minister, Sam Kutesa, said on state television, “We are disengaging the cooperation we are having with North Korea, as a result of U.N. sanctions.”
Even if North Korea’s commercial ties to Africa do eventually fade, relics of the engagement will endure.                                                                                       In Dakar, Senegal’s capital, a soaring, North Korea-built statue — larger than the Statue of Liberty — rises from a hilltop, depicting a man holding a baby in one arm and embracing a woman with the other. When the statue was unveiled, it angered many people in the Muslim-majority nation, as the woman was scarcely clad. Other North Korean statues, mostly of African revolutionary leaders, were sold to Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Botswana, Benin and Congo. U.N. sanctions introduced in 2016 barred countries from buying any more such statues.
One of the biggest projects is the war memorial outside of Windhoek, where a towering bronze statue of an unknown soldier carrying a rifle stands in front of a slim obelisk. On a recent sunny afternoon, there were no visitors at the park, and one guard slept on the steps.
But from the top of the monument, the view was clear: the city and the rolling hills in the distance, and in the foreground a North Korean-built military base.

The decision by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson bars use of U.S. passports ""to travel in, through, or to North Korea,"" spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement.
The move follows the still-unexplained death of Otto F. Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who was arrested in Pyongyang in January 2016 and sentenced to 15 years in prison with hard labor for stealing a propaganda poster from his hotel.
After nearly 18 months in prison, Warmbier was released on medical grounds last month. He was flown in a coma to his home in Cincinnati, where he died six days later.
The State Department long has warned Americans not to visit North Korea, as it does for conflict zones and other countries with governments seen as hostile — but did not forbid it outright. It thus will become the only country off-limits to U.S. passport holders.
Hundreds of Americans visit North Korea each year on tour groups that specialize in travel to the reclusive country, many citing the allure of a mysterious, little-known part of northeast Asia. Some aid workers, journalists and academics also travel there.
More than a dozen Americans have been arrested and detained in North Korea since 2009. At least three Korean Americans are still held there, including an accounting teacher who was arrested at the Pyongyang airport in April and charged with unspecified criminal acts.
Tillerson decided to ban U.S. travel to North Korea ""due to mounting concerns over the serious risk of arrest and long-term detention"" there, Nauert said.
""The safety and security of U.S. citizens overseas is one of our highest priorities,"" she added.
The restriction will be published next week in the Federal Register and take effect 30 days later. Exceptions can be made on a case-by-case basis for some humanitarian travel, Nauert said.
The action comes as President Trump grapples to find a strategy to pressure North Korea to rein in its robust nuclear weapons and ballistic missile tests in a period of rising tensions.
In April, Trump personally sought the help of Chinese President Xi Jinping to influence North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, but that strategy has largely failed to produce results.
Since then, the administration has added new sanctions on people or companies, including some in China, that do business in or with North Korea.
Earlier this month, North Korea tested a missile that flew a trajectory that U.S. experts said indicated an ability for the first time to cross the Pacific and potentially threaten the United States.
U.S. officials say the country has yet to build a nuclear weapon small enough to fit atop a missile and survive re-entry into the atmosphere, but that is probably a matter of time.
Warmbier's family say they have not received a satisfactory explanation of what led to his death.
North Korean authorities said Warmbier contracted botulism shortly after he was imprisoned, was given a sleeping pill and never woke up. U.S. doctors did not find that version plausible.
Warmbier’s travel agency was Young Pioneer Tours, which advertised with the slogan, ""Budget tours to destinations your mother wants you to stay away from.""
Pioneer Tours said it on its website Friday that the ban is likely to take effect around Aug. 27. After that, “any U.S. national that travels to North Korea will have their passport invalidated by their government.”",http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-fg-norkor-travel-ban-20170721-story.html,la_times
Pentagon confirms Korea tested second ICBM on less than a month,28-Jul-17,"North Korea launched its second intercontinental ballistic missile in less than a month on Friday in a test that indicated remarkable technological progress in the isolated nation’s weapons development, Pentagon officials said.                                Although the Pentagon had yet to make final assessments, independent defense analysts said the two-stage missile appeared the most powerful that Pyongyang has ever tested.       They estimated that it flew about 45 minutes and soared about 1,850 miles into space before it crashed down in the Sea of Japan off the coast of Hokkaido, Japan’s northern island.
If that trajectory were flattened out, the analysts said, in theory the missile has the capability for the first time to threaten California and beyond.                                                               President Trump, who has repeatedly warned of the threat from North Korea and made it a foreign policy priority, issued a statement late Friday expressing, as in the past, objection to the “reckless and dangerous action.”
”The United States will take all necessary steps to ensure the security of the American homeland and protect our allies in the regions,” he said.                                                                             The missile test — issued from a mobile launcher shortly before midnight, and from a rural site not previously used near the Chinese border — appeared designed to show it would be difficult to shoot down.
“A night launch from an unexpected location” was intended to “show us that we don’t have a credible pre-emption option,” said Jeffrey Lewis, a nuclear weapons analyst with the nonpartisan James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies in Monterey.
It was North Korea's 18th missile test this year, placing the nation on a record-setting pace.
Gen. Paul Selva, vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last week that “Kim Jong Un and his forces are very good at camouflage concealment and deception.""
He added that Pyongyang has yet to fine-tune its missile guidance and control systems and hasn’t shown the ""capacity to strike the United States with any degree of accuracy or reasonable confidence of success.""
The latest missile was launched from Mupyong-ni in Chagang province, in northern North Korea.
Pyongyang first tested a prototype ICBM, dubbed the Hwasong-14, on July 4 in a flight that lasted 37 minutes, raising alarms that it had achieved a breakthrough in its missile program.
The high arc of the trajectory led U.S. analysts to conclude for the first time that Pyongyang had attained the capability of building a missile that could reach Alaska and possibly Hawaii.
Although Pyongyang has developed and tested nuclear weapons, it is not known to have developed a nuclear warhead small enough to fit atop an ICBM or robust enough to survive the missile’s fiery reentry into the atmosphere.
But the string of underground nuclear tests and increasingly sophisticated missile flights have led to concerns it could soon develop the capability to launch a nuclear-armed missile at American military targets in Asia — or even the U.S. mainland.
Given that progress, U.S. intelligence agencies recently cut their projections of how long it would take Pyongyang to build a missile capable of reaching the U.S. mainland from four years to one year.
The Pentagon vowed Friday to defend regional allies and noted that the missile did not threaten North America.
“Our commitment to the defense of our allies, including the Republic of Korea and Japan, in the face of these threats, remains ironclad,” Pentagon spokesman Capt. Jeff Davis said in a statement. “We remain prepared to defend ourselves and our allies from any attack or provocation.”
Gen. Joseph Dunford Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Adm. Harry Harris, commander of U.S. Pacific Command, telephoned South Korea’s top military official, Gen. Lee Sun Jin, and “expressed the ironclad commitment” to the U.S.-Korean alliance, the Pentagon said in a statement.
“The three leaders also discussed military response options,” the statement said.
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan called a meeting of his country’s National Security Council.
""I have received information that North Korea once again conducted a missile firing,"" he said. ""We will immediately analyze information and do our utmost to protect the safety of the Japanese people.""
The United Nations Security Council has repeatedly slapped sanctions on North Korea since its first nuclear test in 2006. While the measures have cut the country off from much of the world’s economy, they have failed to halt its advances in military know-how.
Congress this week overwhelmingly passed legislation that would place additional sanctions on North Korea, as well as Russia and Iran, and limit the president’s ability to ease them. The White House has not said if Trump will sign the bill.

                                                                                     ",http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-japan-north-korea-missile-20170728-story.html,la_times
"Senate, House leaders strike a deal on sanctions against Russia, Iran, North Korea",07/26/17,"Senate and House leaders struck a deal late Wednesday to send long-debated sanctions bill imposing new measures against Russia, Iran and North Korea to the president's desk, after securing promises that Congress will consider even more stringent measures against North Korea down the line.

Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., announced that he agreed to have the Senate take up the measure that the House passed Tuesday on a vote of 419 to 3, after House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., agreed that in the near future, the House would ""expeditiously consider and pass enhancements"" to the North Korea portion of the bill.

Chief among the ""enhancements"" Corker had sought up to the last minute was a provision that would have given Congress the ability to block the president from being able to ease punitive measures against North Korea in the future.

Such a provision, known as ""congressional review,"" would have been modeled on similar language in the sanctions bill that pertains to Russia sanctions. In addition to codifying and enhancing existing sanctions against Moscow, the legislation requires the president to notify Congress whenever he wants to change Russia sanctions policy. That notification then triggers a 30-day period in which Congress can vote to prevent the president from easing punitive measures against Moscow.
That level of congressional review is unprecedented in sanctions bills, but was roundly popular in Congress, where many lawmakers have been uneasy about President Donald Trump's apparent coziness with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Despite the administration's considerable efforts to get lawmakers to abandon the congressional review, members and senators endorsed the approach, both for the Russia sanctions in the pending legislation and as a model for future sanctions bills - a reflection of lawmakers' continuing distrust of the president's conduct in foreign affairs.

While House Republican leaders have been noncommittal when it comes to endorsing congressional review as an approach for future sanctions measures, Corker has been one of its most vocal advocates in Congress. He told reporters Wednesday that ""most"" other senators wanted to see such a provision attached to the North Korea sanctions in the legislation - even threatening at one point to strip the North Korea sanctions out of the bill entirely to force more debate.

Earlier on Wednesday, Corker laid out three options for the Senate: Pass the bill as it is, strip the North Korea sanctions provision from it and start negotiating with the House - ""which I know they're adamantly opposed to,"" Corker acknowledged - or try to make more changes to the legislation before sending it back across the Capitol.

In a Wednesday morning forum at The Washington Post, Corker appeared to favor taking out the North Korea provisions entirely, telling Post columnist David Ignatius that what ""likely will happen is we will strip out the North Korea piece and send it back to them so that the two pieces we've negotiated together will remain intact.""

""That's the likely scenario,"" Corker said, saying that ""it's not an affront, it's just a timing issue.""

But later in the day, he dismissed his commentary as ""just kind of having a flowing conversation"" with Ignatius, saying that senators would pick an option ""in concert with the House . . . and do it very quickly, because we know they're leaving on Friday.""

""Last night when we left the floor, that was what was being discussed,"" Corker added. ""I understand that's not where the House wants to be, and we're going to have to figure something out.""

Meanwhile, the House leaders have been growing impatient with the Senate.

""The House passed the Iran, Russia, North Korea sanctions package in a decisive bipartisan vote of 419-3, and we look forward to the Senate acting on it without delay,"" said AshLee Strong, spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.

Last month, the Senate passed a version of the sanctions bill that contained measures against Russia and Iran only by a vote of 98 to 2. But leaders in the House delayed their action over what they identified as a procedural violations of a constitutional rule that all measures that could affect government revenue must originate in the House.

It took some time to iron out a ""fix"" to that problem, and uponits resolution, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., officially threw North Korea into the sanctions mix, announcing about two weeks ago that the House would package its bill of sanctions against Pyongyang with the Senate-approved measures focused on Russia and Iran. According to one person with knowledge of the discussions, negotiators were always aware that House leaders had hoped to add a North Korea provision to the bill.

Corker's timeline of events is different.

""If we had known that North Korea was coming over, we would have been negotiating those over the last six weeks,"" he told reporters on Wednesday, adding, ""We'll figure it out . . . first and foremost is to cause this bill to become law.""

House leaders also stressed Wednesday that taking a stand against North Korea was a matter of utmost urgency.

""The Senate did not take up the bill, even after Kim Jong Un launched a new ICBM that could soon be capable of hitting California,"" said House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Edward Royce, a Republican from that state. ""Now the House has acted again, by a vote of 419 to 3. Further delay on North Korea is completely unacceptable.""

The resolution appears to have given leaders in both chambers what they wanted: the House will get the Senate's stamp of approval for the North Korea sanctions they initially passed as a standalone bill in May, and the Senate has secured a promise from the House to debate expanded congressional review authority for North Korea - a move that may set a precedent for future sanctions bills, as the provision is extremely popular with the House's rank-and-file.

The precise timing for the Senate to consider the legislation is uncertain, as the chamber is presently occupied with a series of votes related to health care, but senators are expected to vote on the measure this week.",http://www.latimes.com/nation/ct-congress-russia-sanctions-20170726-story.html,la_times
Trump lacks the savvy and skill needed to cope with North Korea or Russia,7/7/2017,"On Thursday, President Trump spent yet another day embarrassing the United States on the international stage. Yes, he gave a pretty good speech before a Polish crowd in Warsaw in which he pledged to defend the values of the West. But then, in a news conference with the Polish president, he proved he was not serious about that pledge.

As Trump stood before the television cameras, he repeated his oft-stated contention that “nobody knows” who hacked the American presidential election, even though U.S. intelligence agencies and most members of Congress know for a fact it was the Russians. He then went on to rail against the free press with his tiresome blather about “fake news.” He even wondered aloud why NBC is not nicer to him since he made them a bunch of money as host of “The Apprentice.”

This nonsense is getting old and boring and it would be a relief if it could simply be ignored, but, of course, Trump’s wayward words have consequences — especially because, today, he is meeting for the first time with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany. If Trump actually cared about the West, or at least about his own country, he would be putting Putin on notice that attacks on America’s democracy will not go unpunished. Trump, though, cannot separate in his mind the proven Russian meddling from his obsession with his clouded victory over Hillary Clinton. Thus locked in his own delusion, he is unlikely to make an issue of the election hack with Putin.

David Horsey cartoons
Instead, we can expect Putin to play to Trump’s self-absorption. It will not be a shock if Trump lumbers out of the session with the cagey Russian proclaiming he has found a new best friend. That is more or less what he did after hosting China’s President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago resort in April. Back then, Trump made himself look foolish by announcing that, after being schooled by Xi for 10 minutes, it dawned on him that the situation with North Korea is really complicated. Maybe he should have read a book or talked to someone in the State Department before he met with Xi, like a normal president. Reportedly, Trump is going into the meeting with Putin just as untutored, with no agenda at all.

While Trump is galumphing around Hamburg meeting with world leaders who laugh behind his back, the wild man who runs North Korea as his own private dungeon is reveling in his latest affront to America. On the Fourth of July, Kim Jong Un’s military shot off its first test of a missile that could hit U.S. soil.

In response, Trump fired of a couple of tweets. One said it is ""hard to believe South Korea and Japan will put up with this much longer.” The other suggested that ""Perhaps China will put a heavy move on North Korea and end this nonsense once and for all.”

The apprentice president must think the cake he served Xi at Mar-a-Lago — “The most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you've ever seen,” Trump bragged at the time — persuaded the Chinese president to dump his impetuous ally, Kim. It ain’t gonna happen.

Americans need to know all our history: the good, the bad and the complex
North Korea is China’s East Germany. The Chinese government does not want to see a united Korean peninsula that is tied closely to the U.S. It perceives that the fall of Kim might very well lead to instability in China. And, the truth is, there is a large faction within Chinese ruling circles who believe anything that is bad for the U.S. is good for China. As a result, they don’t really mind that North Korea is presenting Trump with a thorny problem that has no good solution.

China’s leadership will do what is in China’s interest and they are still far from putting “a heavy move” on Kim. They cannot be expected to go out of their way to help a president whose tough talk dissipates as soon as an autocrat from afar gets him in a room and flatters his ego.

In his Warsaw speech — for once reading from a prepared text instead of winging it — Trump told the crowd, ”The fundamental question of our time is whether the West has the will to survive.” Actually, the more pertinent question, just now, is whether Trump has the attention span and the brainpower required to be the leader of the West. So far, in the judgment of the international community, the answer is a resounding no.

UPDATE: Recently, the Associated Press reported that Environmental Protection Agency Director Scott Pruitt met with Dow Chemical CEO Andrew Liveris shortly before Pruitt’s agency reversed a ban on a chemical manufactured by Dow that has been shown to be harmful to children’s brains. That report was the basis for two sentences in my column on July 2 that drew the inference that the meeting between Pruitt and Liveris may have affected the EPA’s decision.

Now, the AP reports that Rachelle Schikorra, a spokeswoman for Dow, said the formal meeting ""never happened due to schedule conflicts.” Pruitt and Liveris did have ""a brief introduction in passing,” according to an EPA statement, but “no substantive issues were discussed.”

I am glad the AP updated their report and I regret that I formed an opinion based on what appears to be a mistaken account. The broader argument made in my column that Pruitt has dramatically shifted the EPA in a direction favorable to industry remains inarguable. Neither fans nor foes of Pruitt would disagree with that.

"Of 'severe things' Trump is considering, military strike on North Korea is unlikely",6/7/2017,"A pre-emptive military strike may be among the ""pretty severe things"" President Donald Trump says he is considering for North Korea, but it's a step so fraught with risk that it ranks as among the unlikeliest options.

Even a so-called surgical strike aimed at the North's partially hidden nuclear and missile force is unlikely to destroy the arsenal or stop its leader, Kim Jong Un, from swiftly retaliating with long-range artillery that could kill stunning numbers in South Korea within minutes.

An all-out conflict could then ensue. And while Trump's Pentagon chief, Jim Mattis, says the U.S. would prevail, he believes it would be ""a catastrophic war.""

In Poland on Thursday, Trump said the time has arrived to confront North Korea.

""I don't like to talk about what I have planned, but I have some pretty severe things that we're thinking about,"" the president said. ""That doesn't mean we're going to do them.""

Trump didn't mention which ""severe"" options he is weighing following North Korea's July 4 test-launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile. The administration has been reviewing its overall North Korea policy for months, having declared earlier attempts at ""strategic patience"" with the North to have failed. The administration has spoken about starving North Korea of cash for its nuclear program and getting other countries to add diplomatic and economic pressure.

But Trump and his aides have not have ruled out the possibility of war with an adversary that is openly defying U.N. Security Council resolutions and threatening the United States.

To punish North Korea, U.S. considers sanctions on Chinese companies
""It's a shame that they're behaving this way,"" Trump said, ""but they are behaving in a very, very dangerous manner and something will have to be done about it.""

Trump was referring to North Korea's test-launch Tuesday of an unarmed ballistic missile that for the first time demonstrated the range needed to reach U.S. soil. The ICBM was launched on a lofted trajectory so that it fell short of Japan. U.S. analysts calculated that if it is launched on a standard attack trajectory, the missile could reach Alaska. With further testing, they say, North Korea will achieve even longer ranges.

The missile launch created a new reality for the U.S. and its South Korean and Japanese allies, which already are in range of the North's missiles. With a population of more than 20 million, Seoul is in easy range of North Korea's massive array of artillery guns north of the Demilitarized Zone that forms a buffer between North and South. Japan could also be a target. Beyond the nuclear threat, the North also is believed to have chemical and biological weapons.

The U.S. has about 28,000 troops in South Korea, and Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says about 300,000 U.S. citizens are in Seoul alone. Dunford predicted in June 12 that war casualties would be heavy — ""and many of those casualties will be in the first three, five, seven days of the war where all those people in the greater Seoul area (are) exposed to the North Korean threat that we will not be able to mitigate initially.""

Mattis told a House committee last month that if it came to a fight, the U.S. and its allies would prevail, but at a cost that is difficult to imagine.

""It will be a war more serious in terms of human suffering than anything we've seen since 1953,"" he said, referring to the final year of the Korean War. Then, U.S. forces siding with South Korea fought North Korea to a stalemate. It was an era when the North had no nuclear or chemical weapons.

Trump has said he will not allow North Korea to achieve what it calls its ultimate objective: a nuclear-armed missile capable of reaching the United States. Although the North has now shown it can reach U.S. soil, it probably isn't capable yet of arming such a missile with a nuclear warhead. If allowed to stay on its current course, analysts say, the North probably will reach its goal within a few years.

In an impromptu encounter at the Pentagon on Thursday, Mattis told reporters that this week's missile launch didn't threaten the U.S. He said it doesn't change the administration's determination to pursue diplomacy to resolve the nuclear threat, but he suggested North Korea might eventually push too hard.

""Any effort by North Korea to start a war would lead to severe consequences"" for that country, he said.

Mattis said the North's intercontinental missile capability doesn't ""in itself bring us closer to war.""

Trump, he said, has been clear ""we are leading with diplomatic and economic efforts.""

As of Thursday there were no outward signs of U.S. moves to put more air, ground or naval forces in South Korea.

Bruce Bennett, a North Korea expert at the Rand Corp., a federally funded think tank, said a fully effective U.S.-led bombing campaign would require precise intelligence about the locations of the North's nuclear and missile storage and launch sites, a number of which are dug into mountainsides.

""We don't know where they all are,"" he said. ""Even if you knew where they all are, you're going to take potentially weeks of bombing to take those things all down.""

In the meantime, the North would certainly respond with its large and well-armed military, he said.

""North Korea has been very clear that if you (attacked) even one of those facilities, they are going to significantly escalate in response,"" Bennett said. ""They have threatened to turn Seoul into a sea of fire.""",http://www.latimes.com/nation/ct-north-korea-us-military-strike-20170706-story.html,la_times
"N. Korea mysteriously nixes beer fest, but unveils new brew",07/27/2017,"North Korea has suddenly canceled a popular monthlong beer festival, but people won't be going thirsty in a country where brews are cheap and carry the ruling family's seal of approval.

Last year's inaugural festival along the Taedong River was a surprise hit with tourists and Pyongyang residents alike. This year's event, scheduled to begin Wednesday, was scrapped for unknown reasons at a time when international criticism over the death of an American tourist and the July 4 test of Pyongyang's first intercontinental ballistic missile have left the country's nascent tourism industry in limbo.


North Korea's premier brewery had crafted a new beer for the festival, and unveiled it Wednesday despite the cancellation. Taedonggang Brewery's eighth specialty brew has not been bottled yet and does not even have a formal name, but it's available in kegs as draft.

Taedonggang beers are generally reputed to be world-class, which is a matter of national pride among many North Koreans.

Though not as popular as soju, a much stronger, clear alcohol distilled from rice, beer is readily available all over the country and prices are low.

A pint at the Taedonggang beer hall just across the street from the sprawling brewery campus cost about $2. But beer at a stand-up bar on Pyongyang's fancy new Scientists' Street is sold by the liter for about 500 North Korean won, or about 6 cents if calculated at the unofficial but widely used exchange rate of roughly 8,000 won to the dollar.

Han Hyong Chol, head of quality management, told The Associated Press Taedonggang's brewery pumps out 200 kiloliters (53,000 gallons) of beer every day to meet the demand of beer drinkers in the North Korean capital — a city of about 3 million — where it's distributed to 160 beer halls.

According to brewery history, the plant on Pyongyang's outskirts was built at the order of Kim Jong Il, current leader Kim Jong Un's father, in 2001 and began production the following year.

The brewery courtyard features a large mural of Kim Jong Il wearing a white lab coat and holding a trademark green Taedonggang bottle while smiling broadly before a production line. Several larger-than-life photos of Kim conducting ""on-the-spot guidance"" hang in brewery production halls.

""He instructed our managers and technicians that as a socialist country we must provide the people with the best beer in the world,"" a guide replied when asked what kind of guidance Kim had to offer.

The state-run brewery employs about 700 people, but is mostly automated. It takes about 20 days to produce each batch of beer.

The brewery gave The Associated Press the public first taste of its latest brew, made from wheat and hops.

It's not bitter, which is a plus. One comment was, oddly enough, ""minty."" But it also seemed a bit flat, though that might have something to do with a lot of pre-taste-test jostling of the keg.

Brewery officials said they studied techniques and beers from around the world when setting up the brewery. It's suspected they drew particularly heavily on British and German know-how, but Han had no comment on that.

Han also had no comment on the sudden cancellation of the beer festival, though it's certainly another serious hit to the reputation of tourism in North Korea.

Pyongyang has been pushing tourism hard as a revenue stream, but the case of Otto Warmbier and others has raised safety and ethical concerns among potential foreign customers.

U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to soon formally announce a ban on travel to the country by American citizens after the death of Warmbier, a college student who was jailed for allegedly trying to steal a propaganda banner while visiting North Korea. He fell into a coma for unknown reasons soon after his March 2016 sentencing, yet Pyongyang revealed nothing about his condition for more than a year. The North allowed him to return to the U.S. last month, but he died days after coming home.

The number of Americans in North Korea is quite small — probably in the dozens, if that. Three are in prison.",http://www.latimes.com/travel/cruises/sns-bc-as--nkorea-beer-for-the-masses-20170727-story.html,la_times
"To punish North Korea, U.S. considers sanctions on Chinese companies",6/7/2017,"Having lost patience with China, the Trump administration is studying new steps to starve North Korea of cash for its nuclear program, including an option that would infuriate Beijing: sanctions on Chinese companies that help keep the North's economy afloat.

It's an approach that's paid off for the U.S. in the past, especially with Iran, where American economic penalties helped drive Tehran to the nuclear negotiating table. Yet there are significant risks, too, including the possibility of opening a new rift with Beijing that could complicate U.S. diplomatic efforts on other critical issues.

The renewed look at ""secondary sanctions"" comes as Washington seeks a forceful response to North Korea's test this week of an intercontinental ballistic missile that could strike the United States. Few are advocating a military intervention that could endanger millions of lives in allied South Korea across the border. But options for turning the screw on the North financially also are imperfect.

""I don't like to talk about what I have planned, but I have some pretty severe things that we're thinking about,"" President Donald Trump said Thursday during an appearance at a news conference in Poland. ""That doesn't mean we're going to do them.""

He said the U.S. would be watching what happens in the coming weeks and months but chided North Korea for ""behaving in a very, very dangerous manner"" and added: ""Something will have to be done about it.""

North Korean missile advances put new stress on U.S. defenses
Already, a wide array of U.S. and international sanctions target North Korean entities and officials, making it illegal for Americans to do business with them. The U.S. also has pursued companies outside North Korea accused of surreptitiously helping the communist country, such as a small Chinese bank the U.S. penalized last week for allegedly laundering money for North Korea.

But the U.S. thus far has avoided what sanctions experts describe as a logical escalation: secondary sanctions targeting banks and companies that do any business with North Korea — even legitimate transactions that aren't explicitly prohibited by U.N. Security Council resolutions.

Nikki Haley, Trump's U.N. ambassador, told an emergency session of the council Wednesday that the world must do more to ""cut off the major sources of hard currency to the North Korean regime.""

""We will look at any country that chooses to do business with this outlaw regime,"" Haley said.

On the Korean Peninsula on Thursday, South Korean jets and navy ships fired a barrage of guided-missiles into the ocean during drills, a display of military power two days after North Korea test-launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile. The live-fire drills off South Korea's east coast were previously scheduled.

In a show of force, South Korea and the United States also staged ""deep strike"" precision missile firing drills on Wednesday as a warning to the North. Thursday's drills were aimed at boosting readiness against possible maritime North Korean aggression. They involved 15 warships including a 3,200-ton-class destroyer, as well as helicopters and fighter jets, South Korea's navy said.

""Our military is maintaining the highest-level of readiness to make a swift response even if a war breaks out today,"" said Rear Adm. Kwon Jeong Seob, who directed the drills, according to the statement.

Potential sanctions targets previously identified by the Treasury Department include companies based in China, U.S. officials have said. Some may have no business with Americans or U.S. firms, making it harder for the U.S. to limit their operations or freeze assets. But secondary sanctions would still force such companies to stop doing business with North Korea or risk losing their access to the U.S. financial system, and with it, the dollar — the world's main currency for global trade and finance.

Beijing steadfastly opposes such measures. It says sanctions would hurt China's interests and criticizes the approach for being one-sided, as opposed to international penalties that are globally agreed.

""The U.S. needs to understand the Chinese will never allow Chinese companies and individuals to be designated (for sanctions) at the U.N., and the U.S. dollar is still pre-eminent. So the U.S. has leverage,"" said Anthony Ruggiero at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which advocates for a tough approach to North Korea's nuclear program.

Trump, in recent days, appears to have concluded that his early efforts to enlist China's cooperation on North Korea haven't paid off. On Wednesday, Trump took to Twitter to chastise China for allowing its trade with the North to grow in recent months even as the U.S. urged a reduction.

""So much for China working with us — but we had to give it a try!"" Trump wrote.

Senior U.S. officials said imposing sanctions on companies dealing with the North was among several steps considered after the ICBM launch, as U.S. intelligence, military and diplomatic officials reviewed different possibilities.

The Trump administration hasn't given up hope China will change course and step up pressure on North Korea, officials said.

In Congress, lawmakers have proposed new sanctions on North Korea's shipping industry and alleged use of slave labor. The House passed a bill in May, but the Senate has yet to approve it.

Secondary sanctions on North Korea would borrow from President Barack Obama's Iran approach before the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran. After Congress authorized such penalties, the Obama administration worked with nations around the world to get them to reduce their oil imports from Tehran, while negotiating secretly with Iranian officials. The sanctions effectively deterred European firms from doing business with Iran and commercial powers such as China and India were encouraged to buy less Iranian petroleum.

North Korea's isolation, which is far greater than Iran's was, could make it even more susceptible to such pressure. China accounts for about 90 percent of North Korea's trade.

But China has leverage, too, which is why previous U.S. administrations have held back. China is now the world's second-largest economy, it holds trillions of dollars in U.S. debt and its companies are increasingly tied financially with the West. And angering Beijing could lead to unpredictable responses in places like the South China Sea, where Beijing has various territorial disputes with America's allies and partners in Southeast Asia.

""It will put a magnifying glass on Chinese businesses that the Chinese government may not want,"" said Doreen Edelman, an attorney at Baker Donelson who specializes in sanctions compliance.",http://www.latimes.com/nation/ct-north-korea-sanctions-chinese-companies-20170706-story.html,la_times
Tough sanctions approved by U.N. could cost North Korea $1 billion in exports annually,5/8/2017,"The U.N. Security Council on Saturday unanimously approved a sanctions resolution that the United States said was the strictest imposed “on any country in a generation,’’ banning North Korea from exporting many of its most lucrative products, ranging from coal to iron ore to seafood and even some of its artwork.

The tough new sanctions would slice $1 billion from North Korea’s total annual exports of $3 billion, the State Department said.

""This resolution is the single largest economic sanctions package ever leveled against the North Korean regime,"" said United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley. ""This is the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation.""

The U.S.-drafted resolution has been in the works since July 4, when North Korea tested an intercontinental ballistic missile capable of reaching Alaska. That was followed up by another test July 28, which helped the United States persuade China and Russia, North Korea’s traditional allies, to overcome their opposition to the resolution.

President Trump, whose administration has been struggling on how to respond to North Korea’s recent actions, signaled his approval on Twitter. “The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 to sanction North Korea. China and Russia voted with us. Very big financial impact!”

Trump has been at odds with China and Russia on a variety of issues, but on Saturday night the White House released a statement saying that the president “appreciates China’s and Russia’s cooperation in securing passage of this resolution. He will continue working with allies and partners to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea to end its threatening and destabilizing behavior.”

If enforced, the biggest financial hit of the resolution will be the ban on coal, which alone brings in more than $400 million in revenue for Kim Jong Un’s government. The ban on the export of seafood, prized in Asia because of the relatively clean North Korean waters, will trim an additional $300 million from the country’s exports, according to the State Department.

The resolution also sets a cap on the number of North Korean guest workers abroad, a figure estimated to be at least 50,000 — with their salaries almost entirely paid to the government. And the resolution freezes the assets of the Mansudae Art Studio, which has been building Soviet-style statues and monuments for dictatorial governments around the world, mostly in Africa.

Another key measure is that the resolution slapped an asset freeze on the Foreign Trade Bank, North Korea’s primary bank for foreign currency exchange — something that the United States has long demanded.

The resolution will also allow the U.N. to ban specific vessels that are breaking sanctions from entering ports all over the world.

This is the eighth time since 2006 that the U.N. Security Council has adopted a resolution in response to North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests. Frustrated North Korea analysts were dubious that this latest measure would halt Pyongyang’s juggernaut toward the development of a workable nuclear warhead.

The Trump administration sends mixed messages on North Korea
Objections by China and Russia led the resolution drafters to remove a clause that would have barred imports of fuel oil to North Korea. And more important, the resolution didn’t impose sanctions on the Chinese companies and individuals who have helped North Korea evade sanctions.

“The bottom line is that it’s the same old thing. It is not going to get implemented,’’ said a U.N. official who asked not to be quoted by name given the sensitivity of the issue.

“While the restrictions seem tough on the surface, they rely on the Chinese and Russians to enforce them,’’ said Anthony Ruggiero, an analyst for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He said the resolution might actually be counterproductive in that it will allow China and Russia to claim they are cooperating in efforts to rein in North Korea.

“The U.S. government had been moving towards sanctioning Chinese companies and individuals, but they have backed away from that,’’ said Ruggiero. “I fear people in the Trump administration will now say, ‘Well, we can’t do anything more because we have to give the Chinese the chance to implement the new resolution.’”

Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Tuesday before leaving for a trip to Asia that the United States isn’t trying to overthrow Kim, but hopes sanctions will serve as “peaceful pressure” to bring his government to negotiations.

“We’re trying to convey to the North Koreans we are not your enemy, we are not your threat,” he added. “But you are presenting an unacceptable threat to us, and we have to respond.”

Kim, one of the youngest world leaders, took over with the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, in 2011, and has since accelerated the pace of missile and nuclear tests. In its official statements, North Korea has said it needs nuclear weapons to prevent Kim from being overthrown by the West in the manner of Iraq’s Saddam Hussein and Libya’s Moammar Kadafi.

The resolution Saturday said that the United Nations regrets North Korea’s “massive diversion of its scarce resources toward its development of nuclear weapons and a number of expensive ballistic missile programs” while “over half of the people” in the country “suffer from major insecurities in food and medical care.’’

By Sunday afternoon in Pyongyang, the North Korean government had not responded publicly on the U.N.’s action.

But a week earlier, the government offered a damning comment after Trump signed a bill that imposed economic sanctions on North Korea, Iran and Russia. The official Korean Central News Agency quoted an unnamed official with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs who said, “The act of the U.S., which is so fond of rigging up sanctions law and brandishing the sanctions club against other sovereign states, is no better than a hooligan which cannot be allowed by international law as well.”",http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-north-korea-sanctions-20170805-story.html,la_times
"In Warsaw, Trump says Russia and 'other people' meddled in election, warns North Korea",6/7/2017,"On the eve of his first face-to-face talks in office with Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Trump declined to hold the Kremlin solely responsible for meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign, saying others may have interfered as well.

At a news conference Thursday with his Polish counterpart in Warsaw, Trump also said he was considering some unspecified “pretty severe things” in response to North Korea’s firing of a ballistic missile capable of hitting parts of the United States. “Something will have to be done about it,” he told reporters.

Later, in a speech delivered in an iconic Warsaw square, Trump cast Islamic extremism as a modern-day successor to historic horrors like Nazism and Communist oppression.

“We must stand united against these shared enemies,” he said, his address repeatedly interrupted by raucous cheers and chants. “Our borders will always be closed to terrorism and extremism of any kind.”

Portraying the struggle against terrorism as the West’s primary mission, the president cited “dire threats to our security and our way of life” that must be countered by “bonds of culture, faith and tradition that make us who we are.”

Speaking against the backdrop of a memorial to the 1944 Warsaw Uprising against the Nazis, Trump praised Polish perseverance and sacrifice, asking: “Do we have the desire and the courage to preserve our civilization in the face of those who would subvert and destroy it?”

To NATO allies, Trump offered an explicit commitment to the alliance’s founding principle of common defense, which he had failed to state unambiguously at a May meeting in Brussels. But he also again tweaked allies who he said were not contributing enough financially, taking credit for “billions and billions” coming into NATO as a result of his importuning members to pay more.

Trump’s characterization of Russian election interference was considerably more tepid than U.S. intelligence assessments that the Kremlin directed a concerted campaign of cyber meddling meant to help him beat his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton. In his comments, he repeated an assertion that “nobody really knows” who bore the ultimate responsibility.

“I think it was Russia, and it could have been other people in other countries,” he said. “I think a lot of people interfere.”

Even while leaving conditional the degree of interference by Moscow — “if Russia did it,” as he put it — Trump also renewed an attack against his predecessor, President Obama, saying he had failed to act on intelligence pointing to Russian interference that surfaced months before the election.

“That’s a lot of time, he did nothing about it,” said Trump, who was to meet Putin on Friday on the sidelines of the Group of 20 gathering in the German city of Hamburg.

On North Korea, the president declined to provide specifics about potential options under consideration to rein in the North’s leader, Kim Jong Un.

“I don’t like to talk about what we have planned,” he said, adding: “They are behaving in a very, very dangerous manner.”

Seeking to isolate North Korea, U.S. warns diplomatic window is closing
Trump was welcomed warmly by Polish President Andrzej Duda, a right-wing populist who has cracked down on immigration, the judiciary and freedom of the press.

The two leaders met privately at the national Royal Castle in Warsaw before giving public remarks and taking questions from the media.

“Mr. Trump is thinking very seriously about Poland’s security,” Duda told reporters, adding that he was convinced by his meeting with Trump that the U.S. is “our loyal ally.”

In advance of the American president’s speech in front of a memorial to Polish resistance to Nazi occupation, supporters of the ruling Law and Justice party lined the street outside a small but landmark square, holding banners and Polish and American flags.

A few people wore the bright red baseball hats from Trump's campaign with the words ""Make America Great Again"" written in white across the top. As a few lawmakers from opposition parties walked through security, chants in the crowd went up, calling them ""thief"" and ""traitor"" in Polish.

Trump’s visit to Poland marks a brief stop in an environment friendlier than the one that likely awaits him in Germany. Several European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, have been sharply critical of Trump’s protectionist policies on trade and his decision to pull the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord.

Trump’s visit to Europe comes as he faces urgent foreign policy tests on multiple fronts. In addition to North Korea’s missile adding urgency to Trump’s calls for China to do more to pressure Kim to end his nuclear program, the fight against Islamic State in Syria has reached a critical point.

After the Warsaw stop, Trump will fly to Hamburg for a sit-down with Merkel on Thursday evening and a joint meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in.

Like Trump, Duda was swept into power with a nationalist-populist message. He promised to protect Polish interests from international agreements and has set tight limits on immigration despite pressure from western European leaders to accept more refugees from war-torn countries like Syria.

Since being elected in 2015, Duda has launched a public campaign against the press and tried to undermine Polish media outlets. In the past year, Duda’s administration and his allies that control the legislature have restricted government access to reporters, a clampdown on press freedom that sparked large protests in Warsaw in December.",http://www.latimes.com/nation/ct-trump-in-poland-20170706-story.html,la_times
"South Korea, U.S., Japan vow 'maximum pressure' on N. Korea for dialogue",12-Jul-17,"South Korea, the United States and Japan agreed Wednesday to continue joint efforts to put ""maximum pressure"" on North Korea in order to bring it to the negotiating table.                                                         The three countries strongly condemned the North's launch last week of a ballistic missile with intercontinental range during a video conference of their defense officials, according to the South's Ministry of National Defense.
It was meant to share information on the latest provocation and discuss countermeasures. 
They pointed out that the July 4 missile firing was in clear violation of multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions imposing sanctions on Pyongyang and emphasized the communist regime's development of weapons of mass destruction poses a grave threat to global peace and stability, the ministry said.
The regional powers reaffirmed the importance of coordination to achieve the ""complete and irreversible"" denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and coax the North into halting provocations and returning to dialogue.
South Korea was represented by Chang Kyung-soo, acting chief of the ministry's policy planning office. His counterparts were David F. Helvey, U.S. assistant secretary of defense for Asian and Pacific security affairs, and Satoshi Maeda, director general for Japan's defense policy.
The reclusive North claimed that it successfully test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM), named the Hwasong-14, as Americans marked Independence Day.
Launched on the ""maximum-lofted"" trajectory, it said, the missile reached an apogee of 2,802 kilometers and flew 933 km for 39 minutes.                                                                                                              But there are growing doubts about whether the North has actually mastered ICBM technology.
It would need at least a few more years to develop an ICBM to strike the U.S. mainland, according to Chang Young-keun, a missile expert at Korea Aerospace University.
Citing an simulated analysis, he said the North fired the missile with a 900-kg warhead on a lofted angle to reduce the maximum altitude and avoid possible technical trouble.
""A simulation showed that its range came to only 6,200 km,"" Chang said in a report. ""If a standard warhead is loaded onto the Hwasong-14 ICBM, it can be used for an attack on Alaska and Hawaii. Its range falls short of a level to hit the U.S. mainland.""
The distance between Pyongyang and San Francisco is about 9,000 km.
He said the Hwasong-14 is believed to be 19.5 meters long, with an 11-meter-long and 1.4-meter-diameter first-stage booster.
The North is expected to focus on developing a small warhead in a bid to extend the range of its ICBM, a work likely to take two or three years.
He echoed an assessment by the South's state intelligence agency that it remains unconfirmed whether the Hwasong-14 succeeded in atmospheric re-entry, a key element for an ICBM. (Yonhap)

World Beware! - if North Korean leader goes missing from media for more than a week,13-Jul-17,"Should the world be worried if North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ""disappears"" from the reclusive state's media for more than a week?
Korean news outlet the JoongAng Ilbo's recent report suggests it should.
The report showed that when Kim disappeared from North Korean media for more than a week a major provocation, or ""jaw-dropping"" incident, tended to happen. Related events were the surprising execution of Kim's uncle Jang Song-thaek and military top brass, ballistic missile firings and an underground nuclear test.
Kim has gone missing from the media for more than a week 27 times since he inherited power from his father Kim Jong-il in 2011 -- 10 times in 2012, seven in 2013, once in 2014, none in 2015, four in 2016 and five so far this year.                                                                              Kim recently disappeared for 13 days before the firing of the ""Hwasong 14"" intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) on July 4.
His last exposure in the hermit state's media before that was June 20, when he visited a dental hygiene product factory.
The same lack of exposure was seen during past military provocations.
On May 14, when North Korea fired the ""Hwasong 12,"" a new intermediate-range missile, Kim had not appeared for eight days.
On Feb. 7, 2016, the country fired the ""Kwangmyongsong 4"" satellite, which was viewed by many as a cover for testing its ICBM technology. Kim was missing from the media for nine days.
On Sep. 9, 2016, just before North Korea's fifth nuclear test, Kim was not seen for six days.
""Considering the North Korean media reported that Kim Jong-un personally looked after the military provocation, it seems that he was focused on personally overseeing and controlling the missions,"" Jeon Hyun-joon, director of the Northeast Asia Peace and Cooperation Research Institute, told the JoongAng Ilbo.
The same could be said for other game-changing events in North Korea.
On Dec. 12, 2013, when Kim's uncle Jang Song-thaek was executed, Kim had not been seen for eight days.
On July 2012, when Chief of the General Staff Ri Yong-ho was presumed executed, Kim was missing for seven days.
""Beside from the 40 days Kim disappeared in September 2013, for an alleged leg injury, Kim's disappearance from local media for more than a week was followed by a crucial event inside North Korea,"" Jeon said. ""Therefore, we should check every possible scenario if Kim becomes absent for a long period of time.""

Seoul can leverage N. Korea issue for FTA talks with US,14-Jul-17,"South Korea should use the North Korean nuclear issue as leverage to get the upper hand in talks to adjust the free trade agreement (FTA) with the United States, analysts said Friday.                                                    They said President Moon Jae-in should pursue a strategy to keep both the U.S. and China competing for their own interests in the resolution of North Korea's problem so it can benefit South Korea in trade negotiations.
""U.S. President Donald Trump really needs South Korea to deal with North Korea, especially given China's cold reaction to Trump's needs, and this clearly gives Korea the upper hand,"" said Alicia Garcia-Herrero, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Natixis.
She believes Moon is trying to play both sides after the severe consequences of THAAD but he should stick with the U.S. for a while until the FTA is renegotiated.
""Moon can also pay attention to the U.S.-China mini-trade deal and learn that small concessions can make a big difference to Trump,"" she said. ""As a good populist, he needs a headline more than a solution.""
In this regard, it is important to identify areas where Trump and his administration seek to increase exports.
Analysts said the energy sector is the area where both nations can find a win-win solution in FTA renegotiations.
""The U.S. wants to export energy. Korea should finance gas liquefaction plants in the U.S. and import LNG,"" independent economist Andy Xie told The Korea Times.
""Also, the agricultural market should be opened up completely to U.S imports. If Korea does these two things, the Trump administration will be satisfied.""
Tara O, an adjunct fellow at the Pacific Forum Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), echoed Xie's view, saying importing shale gas from the U.S. could be an alternative solution.
""South Korea is already importing energy, and buying it from the U.S. would be a win-win situation,"" she said.
""It is important to find mutually beneficial situations that boost the national interests of both countries and strengthen the blood-forged alliance.""
The advice came as the Korean government says the U.S. is seeking modest amendments to the agreement, while President Trump made it clear the U.S. is renegotiating its trade agreement with Korea.
Trump has called the FTA with Korea a ""horrible"" deal.
""So we're starting, we started, as of yesterday, renegotiating the deal with South Korea. We have to,"" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on the way to Paris on Wednesday night.
Trump's remarks came a day after the U.S. notified South Korea it wants to start the process of revising the FTA between the two countries. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative called for convening a meeting in Washington in August to discuss possible amendments and modifications to the FTA.
Experts said Seoul should try to see the trade imbalance issue in the global context and come up with a new approach to rebuild economic ties with the U.S.
In particular, it's important to highlight that the U.S. has deficits with most countries and it's not a Korea-specific problem, the experts said.
""FTA renegotiation is inevitable. East Asian economies must open up more to the U.S. to maintain access to the U.S. market,"" Xie said. The former Morgan Stanley economist is well-known for having forecast the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis.
""The old approach of keeping this sector or that sector sacred against import competition won't work,"" he said. ""Korea should open up the sectors in which it has lost competitiveness and shift resources to where it is gaining.""
In order to avoid hidden pitfalls, Seoul is advised to bring China into the picture when preparing for renegotiations, particularly in the automotive industry.
""The (U.S.) deficit with Korea is actually much larger if one takes into account that many components are made in Korea, then sent to China and assembled into final products, then get exported to the U.S.,"" said Mauro Guillen, director of the Lauder Institute at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.
""I think right now the best strategy is to document the ways in which trade between the two countries benefits both.""
William Brown, adjunct professor at Georgetown School of Foreign Service, said that on cars, the Korean side may present this as a U.S.-Korea issue but the U.S. side might discuss the China factor.
According to Brown, in Korea's trade data for May 2017, South Korea exported almost zero cars to China, whereas just a few years ago it sold tens of thousands. Instead, its cars go to the U.S.
There is one thing Korean policymakers must remember for the FTA renegotiation: the U.S. anti-free trade policy is here to stay, not a passing phenomenon among Trump and a few conservative politicians.
""There is widespread consensus among the U.S. ruling elite that the U.S. has opened itself up too much to the world and has not gotten the same from others, and that is the reason the U.S. has weakened,"" Xie said. ""This thinking will continue to dominate U.S. policy after Trump.""",http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2017/07/602_233037.html,Korea_Times
S. Korea proposes talks with Pyongyang on reunion of families separated by Korean War,12-Jul-17,"South Korea on Monday proposed holding inter-Korean military talks later this week on reducing tensions along the border, a follow-up to President Moon Jae-in's recent peace overture made in his Berlin speech.
Seoul wants to have the rare meeting Friday at Tongilgak, a North Korean building in the truce village of Panmunjom, according to the Ministry of National Defense.                                                                            Its aim is to halt ""all acts of hostility"" near the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) that bisects the two Koreas, the ministry said in a statement read out by Vice Minister Suh Choo-suk.
It requested Pyongyang to respond to the offer through the inter-Korean military communication line in the western region after restoring it.
The ministry, however, did not specify agenda items and the level of chief representative apparently for some flexibility.
If held, it would be the first dialogue between the military authorities of the two sides in almost three years. They had a working-level meeting at Panmunjom on Oct. 15, 2014, on easing tensions but failed to reach an agreement.
In the possible new round of negotiations, the South is expected to suggest that the two Koreas stop sending loudspeaker-based propaganda broadcasts across the MDL. The North will likely focus on blocking the cross-border spread of anti-Pyongyang leaflets by activists here.
Observers say chances are relatively high that the North will agree to hold the military talks although it may counter-propose a date.
As the North's leader Kim Jong-un addressed the 7th Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea in May last year, he voiced hope for military talks with the South, saying it would serve as an opportunity for comprehensive consultations on removing possible risks of an armed clash in the border area and easing tension.
The government made a separate proposal on reopening Red Cross talks to discuss ways to resume family reunions on the occasion of the Chuseok holiday in early October. 
Such a joint event was last held in October 2015 to arrange the reunion of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.
The South's Red Cross delivered the offer of holding the talks on Aug. 1 at the Peace House, a Panmunjom building controlled by the South. It said it's waiting for the North's reply through the now-dormant liaison office in Panmunjom.
The Moon administration is eager to restart humanitarian assistance and exchanges despite no let-up in the North's provocations highlighted by its July 4 firing of a ballistic missile with intercontinental range. 
Unveiling his peace vision in the German capital earlier this month, the South's liberal leader stressed the importance of dialogue to address the current situation, which he described as ""highly dangerous.""
He said his government will strive to establish a permanent peace regime on the peninsula on top of continued denuclearization efforts.   Stopping hostile acts along the MDL that escalate military tensions can be a first and meaningful step, as Korea marks the 64th anniversary of the Armistice Agreement on July 27, he added.
In their Washington, D.C. summit in late June, Moon won U.S. President Donald Trump's support for Seoul's attempt to take the driving seat in handling security issues directly involving the Korean Peninsula.
Meanwhile, it's quite uncertain whether the North will return to Red Cross talks.
Pyongyang remains angry about Seoul's refusal to repatriate Kim Ryon-hui, a North Korean defector, saying there will be no formal inter-Korean family reunions without resolving the issue.
The South pointed out that she came here at her own decision and there's no legal ground to send her back, while the North says she has changed her mind to return to the North. (Yonhap)

"Moon's dialogue offer to N. Korea unwelcome in US, Japan",18-Jul-17,"The United States and Japan expressed negative responses to the South Korean government's proposal for inter-Korean dialogue to North Korea, Monday.

This came after Seoul proposed that the two Koreas hold military talks to ease tension along the border, and Red Cross talks to resume reunions of separated families, follow-up measures to President Moon Jae-in's peace overture made during his Berlin speech in early July.

When asked about U.S. President Donald Trump's position on Seoul's proposal, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer expressed reservations, saying conditions for talks with North Korea were not currently present.

""Well, obviously those comments came out of the Republic of Korea and I would refer you back to them,"" Spicer said during a regular press briefing.

""That being said, I think the president has made clear in the past with respect that any type of conditions that would have to be met are clearly far away from where we are now.""

Japan responded with a clearly negative tone, saying now was the time to increase pressure on North Korea.

""This is not a time for dialogue. This is a time for pressure,"" Japan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Norio Maruyama said during a press conference in New York where Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida was attending a United Nations meeting.

Stressing that North Korea had reached ""a new level"" with its latest launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile July 4, Maruyama said increasing international actions was now essential in order to conduct a ""serious dialogue"" with the North in the future.

""Dialogue for the sake of dialogue is meaningless,"" he noted.

On the U.S. response, Seoul's unification ministry insisted Tuesday that there was no gap between the two countries in assessing conditions for talks with Pyongyang.

""We don't see a difference in our understanding,"" a ministry official told reporters.

He said the government had fully explained through diplomatic channels the planned offer for dialogue before its announcement and earned full understanding from Washington.

""The unification minister has repeatedly mentioned since his inauguration that inter-Korean talks should aim at freeze of its nuclear program and denuclearization. The government's offer this time does not mean that conditions for a full-fledged dialogue have been met,"" he said.

""They're early-stage talks to ease tension and deal with humanitarian issues.""

The official added the government will continue working on approaches to the North ""in close coordination"" with the U.S.

Meanwhile, China hailed Moon's offer. Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang said in a press briefing: ""We hope that the two Koreas will make efforts to break the stalemate and create conditions for a resumption of negotiations.""

Pundits say that Moon's offer means that he will not wait until the right conditions for talks with the North are met; rather he intends to make the conditions on his own initiative.

""The government is seeking to bring about such conditions through inter-Korean talks,"" said Nam Sung-wook, a professor of North Korean Studies at Korea University.

Regarding Spicer's comment, he said, ""It seems the U.S. meant it would wait and see how South Korea would take its conciliatory approach. But it is worried that Seoul's independent line could be taken too far.""",http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2017/07/113_233194.html,Korea_Times
"K-pop fans in North Korea? EXO tweets emerge from hermit kingdom Posted : 2017-07-13 16:35Updated : 2017-07-14 10:22
",7/14/2017,"K-pop mega-star group EXO might have finally successfully landed in North Korea.

Twitter Korea recently announced that 15 EXO-related tweets originated from the hermit kingdom, according to the Voice of America, a U.S. government-funded broadcaster Wednesday.

The unusual tweets were discovered when Twitter gathered over 1,100 EXO-related tweets from July 9 to July 10 to commemorate the launch of EXO's official Twitter account.

According to a map Twitter released, EXO-related tweets not only came from large metropolitan areas such as Pyongyang and Hamhung, but also from cities near the border between China and North Korea, such as Sinuiju.

However, it is uncertain if North Koreans or foreigners posted the tweets. But it seems obvious that although the North is notorious for its isolation, its internet connection is not that limited.

North Korea is known only to allow its citizens to use the ""intranet,"" a type of internal network, and not the internet itself.

N. Korea calls off int'l beer festival for 'unknown reasons',7/24/2017,"A China-based tourist agency that arranges tour programs to North Korea said Monday that the North has informed it of the cancellation of a beer festival slated for late July to the end of next month.

Koryo Tours said that it was informed on Sunday that the 2nd Taedonggang Beer Festival has been canceled for an unknown reason. The fest is supposed to be held from July 26 to late August at an excursion ship and the wharf along the Taedong River running through Pyongyang.

""The reason for the cancellation is unclear and we don't expect full information to be forthcoming but it is possibly down to the ongoing drought in the country that has caused a great deal of trouble,"" the agency said on its English-language blog.

It said that the festival for tourists could have been ""excellent mingling and interaction opportunities with hundreds of local people who attend every evening.""

The Korean Central News Agency promoted the fest last week, saying that the country will present a newly produced wheat beer at the festival.

North Korea has been stepping up a campaign to minimize the drought damage in the country's granary areas including the country's western Hwanghae Province.

North Korea's holding of events such as the beer festival and marathons is one of the main sources of hard currency amid tough international sanctions.

The United States said Friday that it will ban its citizens from traveling to North Korea amid concerns about their safety.

The move came after Otto Warmbier, a U.S. college student, died in June after returning from North Korea in a coma following a 17-month detention. (Yonhap)",http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2017/08/103_233501.html,Korea_Times
Moon orders more THAAD deployment, 2017-07-29,"South Korean President Moon Jae-in on Saturday proposed a set of tough countermeasures against North Korea's latest ballistic missile launch, including the deployment of additional THAAD launchers, according to his office.

Presiding over an emergency National Security Council (NSC) session, Moon ordered consultations with the United States on ways to bolster ""strategic deterrence"" against the North, his chief press secretary, Yoon Young-chan, told reporters.

The measures would include a show of the allies' force like a combined ballistic missile exercise and an immediate request for a U.N Security Council meeting to discuss strong sanctions, added Yoon.

Moon convened the NSC meeting shortly after reports of the North's firing of a ballistic missile, which South Korea's military views as an advanced type of ICBM.

Two THAAD interceptor launchers are in operation at a former golf course in Seongju, some 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul, with four others stored at a nearby U.S. military base. American troops here say the THAAD system is a core element in their missile defense against the North's growing threats. (Yonhap)

"China condemns N. Korea's missile launch, urges it to stop escalating tension", 2017-07-29,"China joined South Korea and the United States on Saturday in condemning North Korea's latest launch of an intercontinental-range ballistic missile, urging the North to stop provocative acts.

""China is closely watching the development of the latest situation. ... United Nations Security Council resolutions have clear regulations on North Korea's ballistic missile technology development activities,"" China's foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said in a response to the midnight launch.

""China is opposed to North Korea's (latest) launch activities, which defied UNSC resolutions and the common wish of the international community,"" he also said.

China urged North Korea to ""abide by the UNSC resolutions, stop any act that escalates security tensions on the Korean Peninsula, and join efforts to maintain peace and security in the region,"" he also added.

Around the midnight before Saturday, North Korea fired what it later announced was the Hwasong-14 ICBM. It soared to an altitude of around 3,700 kilometers and flew for more than 1,000 km before landing in the waters between Korea and Japan, according to the South Korean military.

The latest launch was an improvement from the North's another Hwasong-14 launch on July 4, which reached an altitude of about 2,800 km. 

In response to the latest provocation, President Moon Jae-in ordered additional launchers of the THAAD missile defense system be deployed, though a survey of its environmental impact should be continued as planned.

China strongly opposes the decision.

""China voices grave concerns over relevant actions by South Korea,"" the spokesman said. ""Our stance to resolutely oppose the deployment of the U.S. THAAD system in South Korea has been consistent and clear.""

South Korea and the U.S. announced in July last year they would install a THAAD battery to better counter the growing missile threat from North Korea.

China has been against the installation, saying the missile defense system and, in particular, its strong radar system could undercut its military capabilities.

Two THAAD launchers are in operation at a former golf course, some 300 kilometers southeast of Seoul, with the four others having been stored at a nearby U.S. military base.

""Deploying the THAAD system will not address South Korea's security concerns, nor will it solve issues related to the Korean Peninsula, and will only complicate them,"" the spokesman said.

""What I want to emphasize is that the THAAD deployment in South Korea will seriously hurt the strategic balance in this region and undermine China's strategic security interests as well."" ",http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2017/08/103_233836.html,Korea_Times
Koreas should not politicize issue of NK restaurant workers',7/21/2017,"A United Nations human rights envoy called for the two Koreas to focus on the needs of 12 North Korean restaurant workers who defected to the South from China last year, instead of politicizing the human rights issue.

North Korea, which accused the South of abducting the workers, has demanded their return as a condition for the resumption of separated family reunions.

""I urge the two Koreas to avoid politicizing the situation of these women, and strictly focus on their interests, protection needs and the needs of their families,"" Tomas Ojea Quintana, Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in North Korea said at the Seoul Global Center, Friday.

He made the remarks at a press conference held on the final day of a five-day visit to Seoul, marking the launch of the Moon Jae-in administration in May.

Quintana welcomed Seoul's decision to seek dialogue with Pyongyang. The government proposed Monday holding talks for Friday; but the North remained silent.

""This is a reassuring step forward to lower tensions that have built up between the two Koreas over the past months, which echoes the appeal I made to both countries in April to halt conflict rhetoric,"" he said. ""I very much hope that the DPRK will respond positively to the Moon initiative in the interest of long-term peace, security and humanitarian cooperation between the two countries.""

The envoy added: ""The protection of human rights should be central to this policy of rapprochement.""

Last month, a group supporting a North Korean defector wishing to return to his home country, Kwon Cheol-nam, submitted a statement to the U.N. Human Rights Office in Seoul.

Quintana, who met the defector during his visit, said ""We need to remember that many who come from the North to the South are leaving behind relatives and families, so I believe there are human rights implications with regards to this situation that I as a human rights envoy need to look into.""

Quintana also touched upon the death of Otto Warmbier, a U.S. tourist who died last month after being released in coma from a jail in Pyongyang, where he was detained for taking down a propaganda poster.

""The tragic death of Warmbier shortly after his release in a comatose state from a Pyongyang prison was also a reminder to all of us of the dire consequences of the lack of access to consular and legal counsel for those in detention in North Korea,"" he said.

""It is the basic responsibility of any state in the world to respect the conditions of detention, to protect the right to health. Pyeongyang needs offer an explanation to Warmbier's parents and to the international community.""",http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2017/08/103_233408.html,Korea_Times
Activist proposes inter-Korean 'human bridge', 2017-07-12,"The two Koreas need to set up a ""human bridge"" at their border to expand people-to-people exchanges, according to Yoon Yeo-sang, cheif director of the Database Center for North Korean Human Rights (NKDB).

""Like an animal bridge that connects lands over a road, I propose the creation of a human bridge in the Demilitarized Zone. As East and West Germany legalized border crossings before their unification, South and North Korea need to let people move across the border,"" Yoon told The Korea Times, during Jeju Human Rights Conference.

""This is the only measure that will resolve continuous re-defection and re-entry cases of North Korean defectors,"" he said. For years, North Korean woman Kim Ryon-hui has called for her repatriation, claiming she mistakenly arrived in South Korea. However, the Ministry of Unification said her return is impossible under the existing law.

Meanwhile, North Korean authorities have asserted that North Korean restaurant workers who arrived in Seoul last year are being ""detained by force"" in the South.

""By the declaration, two Koreas can provide a permanent platform for reunions of divided families, Korean War prisoners detained in North Korea and unswerving communists here,"" Yoon said.

President Moon has repeatedly vowed to achieve family reunions for those separated since the 1950-53 Korean War.

""Like Germany, the nation should announce it at some point. This is only a matter of time. If there is a security concern, Seoul's National Intelligence Service needs to look into the process according to its rules. Of course, this is different from unofficial defections from North Korea.""

The NKDB has collected evidence of human rights abuses taking place in North Korea since 2003, in order to establish a framework for punishment against those oppressing North Korean residents.

The decreasing number of defectors is a challenge for the NKDB, since its archiving tasks have largely depended on the refugees as sources.

""We are simply gathering victims' testimonies and evidence to help the North Koreans sweep away assailants after the unification,"" Yoon said. ""However, the full process of punishment and social integration is all up to the North Koreans. The South Korean government is not authorized to decide how to use the materials.""",http://koreatimes.co.kr/www/nation/2017/08/103_232846.html,Korea_Times
Russia's oil shipments to NK on sharp increase,11-Jul-17,"Russia's oil exports to North Korea sharply increased in the first four months of the year amid the international community's sanctions on the country, a US broadcaster said Tuesday. 
Russia shipped $2.3 million worth of oil products to North Korea between January and April, up more than 200 percent on-year, Voice of America said, citing Russian customs data.
The amount of the oil shipments posted about 4,100 tons during the period, up 150 percent from a year before, the broadcaster said, adding that some 96 percent of the exports were oil products other than crude oil, such as heavy oil, motor oil, pressure oil and lubricants.                                 Crude oil and oil products, except for aviation gasoline and jet fuel, are not subject to UN sanctions on the North, with aviation oil allowed to be shipped to the country only for humanitarian purposes, the broadcaster said.
North Korea is reportedly turning to Russia for oil supplies as it is having difficulties in securing them amid sanctions, it added.

No negotiation until NK abandons nukes: Pence,11-Jul-17,"With North Korea being defiant in its nuclear ambitions, US Vice President Mike Pence on Monday ruled out the possibility for any negotiations, vowing further economic sanctions instead of a “failed policy” of past administrations.                                                                           “(The US president) ought to be willing to sit down and explore common interests to advance peace, security and prosperity in the world in virtually every case, with North Korea being an exception, unless and until it permanently abandons its nuclear and ballistic missiles ambitions,” he said in an interview with “The Laura Ingraham Show.”
When the host said US President Donald Trump should not have a summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, he replied, “Absolutely.” 
“We’re going to isolate them more and more economically and diplomatically. We will not negotiate to negotiate which is a failed policy of multiple administrations of the past,” Pence added.
His remarks came as Washington pushes for a fresh round of crippling sanctions at the UN while crafting standalone measures over Pyongyang’s intercontinental ballistic test last Tuesday. 
The US has given a draft to China late last week and Ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley aims to put a Security Council resolution to a vote “within weeks,” Reuters reported Tuesday, citing several senior UN diplomats.
But the vote may not take place quickly given the likely resistance of China and Russia, the veto-wielding standing members and the North’s staunch economic and diplomatic backers.
Last week, the 15-nation body failed to issue condemnations over the latest missile launch after Russia rejected to label it an ICBM. The UNSC took three months to adopt a resolution when Pyongyang carried out its last nuclear test in September, due chiefly to the Chinese objections with the level of the sanctions and language. 
China’s Ambassador to the UN Liu Jieyi signaled the rough rides ahead yet again, saying in a Reuters interview on Monday that the council action would depend on how members “see the way forward.” 
“We really must think very carefully about what is the best approach in the Security Council because a resolution, sanctions, are themselves not an objective,” he was quoted as saying. 
Washington, meanwhile, is seeking to tighten its own sanctions against the Kim regime, targeting Chinese companies and banks suspected to have been “funneling cash” into its weapons program, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. 
The Trump administration has been displaying a greater willingness to slap secondary sanctions than its predecessor. In late June, it blacklisted two Chinese citizens and a shipping firm with alleged ties to Pyongyang, while designating the Bank of Dandong, based in the North Korea-Chinese border region, as a money laundering concern. 
The issue is also expected to top the agenda for the top nuclear envoys of South Korea, the US and Japan, who met on Tuesday on the sidelines of a regional security forum in Singapore. 
Seoul’s Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said Monday the two countries are currently in consultations over the secondary sanctions. 
“Whether it be a UNSC resolution or general sanctions, (the US) appears to be engaged in the UNSC negotiations on the position that it will place maximum economic pressure,” she said at a parliamentary session. 
“If the UNSC negotiations are unsatisfactory, I think it would actively consider unilateral sanctions, on which it will closely coordinate with us.”

North Koreans found tweeting about EXO,12-Jul-17,"Ahead of its long-awaited comeback, EXO may have found some fans from perhaps the most unexpected place in the world: North Korea. 
Twitter Korea has unveiled a trend map that highlights all the areas around the globe where EXO fans are located. Of the some 11 million tweets posted between 8 a.m. on Sunday and 7:45 a.m. on Monday, 15 were found to have come from the isolated country.
The cities the tweets were traced to include not only major cities like Pyongyang and Hamhung, South Hamgyong Province, but small and border towns in North Pyongan Province and North Hamgyong Province. 
It remains unclear whether the messages were actually sent by North Koreans or foreigners. The country is notorious for strict restrictions on internet access, which is given to the very upper echelons of the elite and extremely scarce among rank-and-file citizens. 
Yet despite the regime’s tight control, South Korean dramas, films and pop music have for years been enjoying high popularity North Koreans. Many residents, especially in border regions, share them with one another such as by using USB-equipped mobile devices, defectors say.

N. Korea dismisses Moon's peace initiative as 'sophistry',16-Jul-17,"North Korea on Saturday criticized South Korean President Moon Jae-in's initiative for cross-border rapprochement as ""sophistry"" in its first response to the proposal made last week.
The Rodong Sinmun, the North's main newspaper, said the so-called Berlin initiative, which Moon announced in the German capital last Thursday, would not be helpful in improving inter-Korean ties long strained amid the reclusive state's relentless provocations.
""The overall content, enumerated under the name of peace, carries confrontational intentions to quash its neighbor while relying on foreign forces,"" the paper said in a commentary.
""(The initiative) is riddled with sophistries like sleep talking, which only pose hurdles rather than helping improve North-South relations,"" it added.                                                                                                                       During his visit to Berlin to attend the Group of 20 summit, Moon announced the initiative under which Seoul pursues Pyongyang's denuclearization with a security guarantee, and economic and diplomatic incentives, while seeking a peace treaty and dismissing the prospect of forced unification.
The North's paper also dismissed Moon's call for bilateral dialogue and cooperation, demanding a ""fundamental shift in policy and stance.""
While referring to Moon's proposals for the reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War and civil-sector cooperation, the newspaper said that there would not be any nonpolitical exchanges when the fundamental issue of cross-border confrontation remains unmentioned or unresolved. 
It also took issue with the fact that the initiative was unveiled on foreign soil.
""It is nonsensical that (the president) enumerated these crucial issues -- which we, Koreans, should lead in resolving -- before foreigners with different skin colors, with whom we don't share the same language,"" it said.

NK warns US military bases in S. Korea within striking range,14-Jul-17,"North Korea warned Friday that US forces stationed in South Korea are within striking range even if a key unit has moved to a new base located south of Seoul.
The US 8th Army on Tuesday opened its new headquarters at the Camp Humphreys garrison in Pyeongtaek, a port city some 70 kilometers south of Seoul, after a decade of delay in the base relocation. It marked the end of the army's 64-year presence at the Yongsan base in central Seoul.
North Korea's military stationed at the truce village of Panmunjom said that regardless of the location, they cannot avoid North Korea's ruthless firing.                                                                                                     ""The larger the US military base is, the more effectively our military hits targets,"" a military spokesman was quoted as saying by the Korean Central News Agency.
It marked the first time that North Korea's military issued a statement since South Korean President Moon Jae-in took office in May. 
The Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army handles issues related to the inter-Korean armistice which ended armed conflict in the 1950-53 Korean War.
""If (the leadership) issues an order, our military will destroy the US imperialists with salvos of firings,"" the spokesman said.
""If the US sticks to reckless military confrontation despite our warning, it cannot avoid a miserable end.""
About 28,500 American soldiers are stationed in South Korea as a legacy of the Korean War, which ended in a truce, not a peace treaty.

S. Korea sees no gap with US over conditions for talks with NK,19-Jul-17,"South Korea said Tuesday that it does not see a big difference with the United States in understanding that the right conditions for full-fledged talks with North Korea have not been met due to its nuclear and missile aspirations.
Seoul's reaction came amid speculation that the US may be uncomfortable with Seoul's latest offer for inter-Korean dialogue at a time when it is pressing tougher sanctions over North Korea's test of an intercontinental ballistic missile. 
The White House said Monday that current conditions are ""far away"" from those needed to reopen dialogue with North Korea as South Korea proposed inter-Korean military and family reunion talks.                                     But Seoul's Unification Ministry said that the government has fully explained its dialogue offer to the US via diplomatic channels, adding that there is no gap in assessing conditions for talks aimed at North Korea's denuclearization.
""The government's dialogue offer does not mean that conditions for full-fledged dialogue have been met,"" said a ministry official.
""The latest proposal is an attempt for 'the early stage' of talks,"" he added.
South Korea on Monday offered to hold inter-Korean military talks on Friday to ease tensions along the tense border and Red Cross talks on Aug. 1 to resume reunions of families separated by the 1950-53 Korean War.
Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon said that though the right conditions for talks with Pyongyang have not been drawn up, the South made such a proposal to ease military tensions and resolve the urgent issue of separated families.
""This can be seen as measures at an embryonic stage to defuse tensions and bring peace to the peninsula,"" the minister told reporters on Monday.
South Korea's neighboring countries showed mixed reactions to Seoul's dialogue offer. China welcomed it, saying that the move will help ease tensions on the Korean Peninsula. But Japan said that it is not a time to seek dialogue, but to employ sanctions on the North. (Yonhap)",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170718000692,Korea_Herald

N. Korea preparing for new ICBM test in 2 weeks: CNN,20-Jul-17,"WASHINGTON -- North Korea appears to be preparing for another test launch of a ballistic missile of intercontinental or intermediate range in the next two weeks, CNN reported Wednesday.
It quoted two US administration officials as saying that the indications appear in the latest intelligence. Satellite imagery also suggests that the communist nation could be testing components and missile control facilities in the run-up to a launch, officials said, according to CNN.
North Korea's latest missile launch came on July 4 and marked its first test of an intercontinental ballistic missile potentially capable of reaching the mainland US. 
On Tuesday, Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Paul Selva said it did not demonstrate capacity to strike the US ""with any degree of accuracy or reasonable confidence of success.""                                                Still, the missile had the range to reach the US and the deployment of the North's missile systems could be difficult to monitor because the country is ""very good"" at hiding them, he told a Senate hearing.
Pentagon spokesman Cmdr. Gary Ross declined to comment on the report, saying he is unsure of its origin.

Seoul OKs Hyundai Asan‘s bid for NK contacts over memorial service,19-Jul-17,"South Korea's Unification Ministry on Wednesday approved Hyundai Asan Corp.'s bid to contact North Korea as the company seeks to visit the North next month to mark the anniversary of the death of its former chairman.
The operator of the now-suspended inter-Korean tour to Mount Kumgang on North Korea's east coast has held the memorial service for Chung Mong-hun at the mountain since his death in August 2003.
But it did not seek approval for the visit last year due to tensions sparked by the North's nuclear and missile tests.                                              The ministry said that it gave the green light to the company's plan to contact the North. If North Korea sends an invitation, Hyundai is expected to ask the government to approve its bid to visit the North.
If approved, it would mark the first visit by South Koreans to the North under the government of President Moon Jae-in.
In July 2008, Seoul suspended the Kumgang tour project after a South Korean woman was killed by a North Korean soldier at the mountain resort. The program was launched in 1998 under a previous liberal government.
The government announced the flexible resumption of civilian inter-Korean exchanges to an extent that the move would not compromise the international sanctions regime.
But North Korea has turned down South Korean aid groups' move to spur exchanges, in protest of Seoul's support of the latest UN sanctions. (Yonhap)",http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20170719000974,Korea_Herald
